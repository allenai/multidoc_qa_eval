From the interview results we derived four main design goals for an evaluation system, including supporting comparison over time and no-code analysis. We used these goals to design and implement zeno, a general purpose framework for defining and tracking diverse model behaviors across different ML tasks, models, and data types. zeno combines a Python decorator API for defining core building blocks with an interactive UI for creating slices and reports.\u201ddl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3544548.3581268\u201cThis paper presents EvalLM, a novel interactive system that sup- ports prompt designers in refining LLM prompts by evaluating generated outputs on user-defined criteria. In the interface, the user composes pairs of prompts and a set of evaluation criteria, and then employs LLMs to both generate outputs with the prompts and evaluate the outputs on the criteria. Through the explanations pro- vided by the LLM on its evaluation, the user can iteratively refine their prompts, by identifying where they lack, and their criteria, by identifying where they are unclear.\u201ddl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3613904.3642216\u201cIn this paper we propose the design of a graphical tool for fast evaluation of Machine Learning (ML) models performance in classification tasks. The motivation behind this work is to get some intuition on what machine learning model we can use to get the best possible outcome out of our datasets. The designed GUI allows us to decide whether applying data standardization and applying different data dimensionality reduction algorithms based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Also, we can choose between 6 generative and discriminative supervised ML classifiers for making the final predictions, including: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, K-nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron)\u201dIEEE Xplore Full-Text PDF:\u201c### **1. Active Learning Interfaces**\u000bActive learning is a method where the ML model actively selects the most informative data points for annotation. This reduces the volume of data needed for training while speeding up the learning process. By focusing on the most representative samples, active learning minimizes the effort required for data annotation and enhances the efficiency of the model training process. For example, in the context of 6G networks, active learning frameworks can optimize both data acquisition and annotation, leading to improved computational efficiency and adaptability in network intelligence[1].\u201d\u000b\u201c### **2. Specialized Annotation Software**\u000b**WSI2ML** is an example of a specialized annotation software designed for computational pathology. This web-based platform provides a comprehensive toolset for each stage of the ML workflow, from annotation to model validation. By offering a user-friendly interface, WSI2ML simplifies the complex task of annotating whole slide images, which is particularly useful in clinical pathology research. The platform's integrated tools help streamline the annotation process, making it more efficient and accessible to multidisciplinary teams[2].\u201d\u000b\u201c### **3. Collaborative Annotation Tools**\u000bThe **Collaborative Semantic Annotation Tooling (CoAT)** is designed to improve the efficiency and interoperability of semantic annotations, particularly in the secondary use of medical data. CoAT facilitates a collaborative approach to annotation, allowing users to leverage prior annotations made by others. This not only speeds up the annotation process but also helps in achieving a consensus on ambiguous annotations. By enabling cross-institutional data usage and fostering a shared understanding of semantic annotations, CoAT enhances the overall quality and efficiency of the annotation process[3].\u201d\u000b\u201cInteractive features and visual feedback\u000bTLDR: Interactive features and visual feedback in ML evaluation interfaces enhance user engagement and understanding. These tools often incorporate explainable AI techniques, real-time model updates, and intuitive visualizations to streamline the annotation process and provide insights into model behavior.\u201d\u000b\u201c#### 1. Interactive Visualization Tools\u000bInteractive visualization tools provide visual representations of model predictions, facilitating a better understanding of model behavior. These tools often come with features to highlight errors, compare performance across different models, and visualize decision boundaries.\u201d\u000b\u201c#### 2. Model Debugging Frameworks\u000bModel debugging frameworks offer functionalities to test and debug ML models interactively. These frameworks provide interfaces to inspect, modify, and evaluate models on the fly, often supporting various types of inputs and modifications.\u201d\u000b\u201c#### 3. Comparative Analysis Platforms\u000bThese platforms allow users to perform side-by-side comparisons of multiple models or different versions of the same model. Such comparison aids in understanding how changes in model architecture or data affect performance.\u201d",
