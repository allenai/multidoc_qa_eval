The trade-offs often involve computational complexity, scalability, and similarity to real-world problems.\n\nThe various methods for generating hard SAT instances each come with their own set of strengths and weaknesses:\n\n1. Graph-based methods: These approaches, such as those using high-girth bipartite incidence graphs (29, Ans\u00f3tegui et al., 2008) and digraph-based generators (57, Bir\u00f3 et al., 2020), can produce instances that are particularly challenging for certain types of SAT solvers. For example, minimal unsatisfiable SAT instances generated from strong digraphs are considered among the hardest unsatisfiable clause sets (57, Bir\u00f3 et al., 2020). However, these methods may be computationally expensive to generate large instances.\n\n2. Probability distribution methods: Geometrical and geo-regular generators aim to create instances more similar to industrial problems (30, Ans\u00f3tegui et al., 2008). The 0-hidden algorithm offers fine-grained control over instance hardness against local search strategies  (70, Jiang et al., 2023). However, these methods may not always produce consistently hard instances across all solver types.\n\n3. Transformation-based methods: Approaches like the W2SAT framework learn from real-world instances to generate SAT formulas  (71, Yu et al., 2023). This can lead to more realistic benchmarks, but the quality of the generated instances depends heavily on the input data and learning process.\n\n4. Specialized algorithms: Methods like No-Triangle SAT (53, O'Sullivan et al., 2019) and frustrated-loop inspired generators  (54, Ventra et al., 2019) can produce hard instances for specific problem types. However, their applicability may be limited to certain classes of SAT problems.\n\n5. XOR-SAT instances: These are known to be among the hardest benchmarks for many satisfiability solvers, especially those that don't exploit the problem's linearity (28, Zdeborov'a, 2008). However, this very specific structure may not represent the full spectrum of SAT problem types.\n\nA significant challenge in generating hard SAT instances is that many state-of-the-art solvers are designed to quickly focus on specific portions of the search space they handle best  (1, Kautz et al., 0). This adaptability of modern solvers makes it difficult to consistently generate instances that are universally hard.\n\nTraditional random k-SAT generators often struggle to produce consistently hard satisfiable instances  (8, Cayrol et al., 1997). This limitation has driven the development of more sophisticated generation methods.\n\nRecent work has focused on capturing multiple graph statistics exhibited by real-world SAT formulas  (50, Barrett et al., 2019), aiming to create more realistic and challenging benchmarks. However, fully replicating the complexity of industrial instances remains an open challenge.\n\nIn summary, while various methods excel at generating hard instances for specific solver types or problem classes, creating universally hard instances that closely mimic real-world problems remains a significant challenge in the field.\n\nReferences:\n1.

For that purpose, the kSAT uniform random generation is not usable. The other generators of satisfiable instances generate instances that are not intrinsically hard, or exhaustive tests have not been done for determining hard and easy areas.\n\n11. [(50, Barrett et al., 2019) | n_citations: 27 | G2SAT: Learning to Generate SAT Formulas ]: \nPrior work in pseudo-industrial SAT instance generation has relied on hand-crafted algorithms... focusing on capturing one or two of the graph statistics exhibited by real-world SAT formulas\n\n\n\nCharacteristics of Hard SAT Instances\nTLDR: Hard SAT instances often exhibit specific structural properties that make them challenging for solvers. These characteristics include being close to the satisfiability threshold, having high resolution width, and possessing certain graph-theoretic properties.\n\nHard SAT instances are characterized by several key properties that contribute to their difficulty for solving algorithms:\n\n1. Proximity to the satisfiability threshold: Hard instances often lie near the phase transition point where the probability of satisfiability changes sharply  (5, Mitchell et al., 1997). This region typically produces instances that are particularly challenging for SAT solvers.\n\n2. High resolution width: Instances with high resolution width, such as those based on high-girth bipartite incidence graphs, can be extremely difficult for resolution-based SAT solvers (25, J\u00a8arvisalo et al., 2006).\n\n3. Graph-theoretic properties: SAT instances derived from certain graph structures, like Eulerian graphs, can pose significant challenges for resolution-based solvers  (26, Markstrom, 2006). These instances exploit the limitations of common solving techniques.\n\n4. Single-solution instances: Surprisingly, random 3-SAT instances with exactly one solution can be harder to solve than those from the phase transition region, especially as problem size increases  (24, Znidaric, 2005). This challenges the conventional wisdom about instance difficulty.\n\n5. Balanced clause-to-variable ratio: Hard instances often have a specific ratio of clauses to variables that maximizes difficulty  (3, Mitchell et al., 1996). This ratio varies depending on the specific type of SAT problem (e.g., 3-SAT vs. k-SAT).\n\n6. Structural properties mimicking real-world instances: Hard instances that capture multiple graph statistics exhibited by real-world SAT formulas can be particularly challenging, as they combine theoretical hardness with practical relevance [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nUnderstanding these characteristics is crucial for both generating effective benchmark instances and developing more robust SAT solving algorithms. The interplay between these properties and different solving strategies continues to be an active area of research in the SAT community.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The development of effective testing methodologies is crucial for advancing SAT solving algorithms and understanding their strengths and limitations.\n\nThe evaluation and testing of SAT solvers is a critical aspect of advancing the field of Boolean satisfiability problem solving. This process involves several key components:\n\n1. Benchmark Instance Generation: Creating effective benchmark instances is crucial for evaluating SAT solvers. Hard instances are particularly valuable as they challenge solvers and help identify their limitations  (5, Mitchell et al., 1997). However, generating consistently hard instances has proven challenging, as modern solvers quickly adapt to focus on specific portions of the search space they handle best  (1, Kautz et al., 0).\n\n2. Performance Metrics: SAT solver evaluation typically considers factors such as runtime, memory usage, and the ability to find solutions or prove unsatisfiability. For Max-SAT problems, the quality of solutions found is also a key metric  (40, Layeb, 2012).\n\n3. Algorithm Comparison: Evaluations often compare different solving strategies, such as local search methods (e.g., GSAT, Tabu Search) and more advanced techniques like Belief Propagation Guided Decimation  (40, Layeb, 2012) (46, Coja-Oghlan, 2017).\n\n4. Theoretical Bounds: Evaluations may consider known theoretical bounds for certain classes of algorithms, helping to contextualize empirical results  (5, Mitchell et al., 1997).\n\n5. Real-world Applicability: As SAT can model many combinatorial optimization problems, evaluating solvers on instances that reflect real-world scenarios is important for assessing practical utility  (38, Bouhmala et al., 2011).\n\n6.

{"case_id": "913bc2f74263079777db4b94a22d7f5a", "answer_text": "Definition of Unique k-SAT\nTLDR: Unique k-SAT is a special case of the k-SAT problem where a formula has at most one satisfying assignment. It is considered to be as difficult as general k-SAT, with tight relationships between their time complexities.\n\nUnique k-SAT is a variant of the well-known k-SAT problem in computational complexity theory. It is defined as the \"promised version\" of k-SAT where the given formula is guaranteed to have either zero or exactly one satisfying assignment  (35, Xu et al., 2020). This constraint on the number of solutions distinguishes Unique k-SAT from the general k-SAT problem, which may have multiple satisfying assignments.\n\nDespite its more restricted nature, Unique k-SAT is not necessarily easier to solve than general k-SAT. In fact, it has been proven to be as difficult as the general k-SAT problem  (35, Xu et al., 2020). This equivalence in difficulty is further supported by recent research showing a tight relationship between the time complexities of Unique k-SAT and k-SAT  (37, Vyas et al., 2020).\n\nThe significance of Unique k-SAT lies in its potential to provide insights into the nature of satisfiability problems and their computational complexity. By studying this more constrained version of k-SAT, researchers can potentially develop new algorithmic approaches or theoretical bounds that might be applicable to the general case or other related problems in computational complexity theory [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1. [(35, Xu et al., 2020) | n_citations: 2 | Uniquely Satisfiable d-Regular (k,s)-SAT Instances ]: \nUnique k-SAT is the promised version of k-SAT where the given formula has 0 or 1 solution and is proved to be as difficult as the general k-SAT. For any k\u22653, s\u2265f(k,d) and (s+d)/2>k\u22121, a parsimonious reduction from k-CNF to d-regular (k,s)-CNF is given.\n\n2. [(37, Vyas et al., 2020) | n_citations: 0 | Results on a Super Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis ]: \nThe Unique k-SAT problem is the special case where there is at most one satisfying assignment... Improving prior reductions, we show the time complexities of Unique k-SAT and k-SAT are very tightly related: if Unique k-SAT is in 2n(1\u2212f(k)/k) time for an unbounded f, then k-SAT is in 2n(1\u2212f(k)(1\u2212\u025b)/k) time for every \u025b > 0.\n\n\n\nTheoretical Results for Unique k-SAT\nTLDR: Unique k-SAT, like general k-SAT, is NP-complete for k \u2265 3 and exhibits a satisfiability threshold. Theoretical results include complexity bounds, connections to statistical physics, and relationships with random k-SAT models.\n\nUnique k-SAT shares many theoretical properties with general k-SAT, including its computational complexity and phase transition behavior. For k \u2265 3, Unique k-SAT is NP-complete, making it intractable to solve efficiently in the worst case  (14, Tardos et al., 2010). This complexity extends to the counting problem of determining the number of satisfying assignments, which is #P-complete for k-SAT  (13, Montanari et al., 2010).\n\nA central focus of theoretical research on k-SAT problems, including Unique k-SAT, is the study of random instances and their phase transitions. The random k-SAT model is particularly important for understanding the average-case complexity and serving as a benchmark for satisfiability algorithms  (27, Pankratov et al., 2017). A key concept in this area is the satisfiability threshold, denoted as \u03b1_c(k) or \u03b1_sat, which marks the critical clause-to-variable ratio beyond which a random k-SAT formula becomes unsatisfiable with high probability as the number of variables approaches infinity  (6, Shah et al., 2006)  (22, Ding et al., 2014).\n\nFor large k, the satisfiability threshold has been rigorously characterized as \u03b1_sat = 2^k ln(2) - \u0398(1)  (31, Vyas et al., 2019). This threshold behavior is crucial for understanding the difficulty of solving random k-SAT instances, with formulas near the threshold often being the hardest to solve (21, \u5468 et al., 2013).\n\nThe study of Unique k-SAT has also revealed interesting connections to statistical physics. Concepts such as replica symmetry breaking and the proliferation of metastable states have been applied to analyze random k-SAT problems  (4, Zhou, 2004). These connections provide valuable insights into the structure and complexity of satisfiability problems.\n\nRegarding algorithmic performance, the best-known algorithms for Unique k-SAT have similar running time bounds to those for general k-SAT, scaling as 2^(n(1-O(1/k)))  (31, Vyas et al., 2019). This suggests that the uniqueness constraint does not significantly simplify the problem from a worst-case complexity perspective.\n\nSeveral open questions and conjectures continue to drive research in this area. Feige's hypothesis posits that for sufficiently high clause-to-variable ratios, random k-SAT cannot be refuted in polynomial time  (29, Vyas, 2018). Additionally, the \"Super-Strong ETH\" hypothesis suggests that worst-case k-SAT cannot be solved in time 2^(n(1-\u03c9_k(1)/k))  (29, Vyas, 2018).\n\nThese theoretical results collectively paint a picture of Unique k-SAT as a problem that, despite its more constrained nature, retains much of the complexity and rich structure of general k-SAT. The ongoing research in this area continues to deepen our understanding of satisfiability problems and their computational challenges.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(29, Vyas, 2018) | n_citations: 1 | Super Strong ETH is False for Random k-SAT ]: \nFeige's hypothesis for $k$-SAT says that for all sufficiently large clause-to-variable ratios, random $k$-SAT cannot be refuted in polynomial time. It has also been hypothesized that the worst-case $k$-SAT problem cannot be solved in $2^{n(1-\\omega_k(1)/k)}$ time... This hypothesis has been called the \"Super-Strong ETH\", modeled after the ETH and the Strong ETH.\n\n\n\nRelationship between Unique k-SAT and general k-SAT\nTLDR: Unique k-SAT and general k-SAT are closely related in terms of algorithmic performance and complexity. Improvements in solving Unique k-SAT often lead to advancements in general k-SAT algorithms, with their time complexities being tightly linked.\n\nThe relationship between Unique k-SAT and general k-SAT is characterized by a strong algorithmic and complexity-theoretic connection. One of the most significant links between these problems is exemplified by the PPSZ algorithm, which was initially designed for Unique k-SAT but has proven to be equally effective for general k-SAT instances  (17, Hertli, 2011). This algorithm demonstrates that advances in solving Unique k-SAT can directly translate to improvements in general k-SAT solving techniques  (28, Scheder et al., 2017).\n\nRecent research has further solidified the tight relationship between the time complexities of Unique k-SAT and k-SAT. Vyas et al. showed that if Unique k-SAT can be solved in 2^n(1\u2212f(k)/k) time for an unbounded function f, then k-SAT can be solved in 2^n(1\u2212f(k)(1\u2212\u025b)/k) time for every \u025b > 0  (37, Vyas et al., 2020). This result suggests that any significant improvement in solving Unique k-SAT would lead to a corresponding improvement in general k-SAT, albeit with a slight loss in the exponent.\n\nThe similarity in complexity is also reflected in the best-known algorithmic performance for both problems. Currently, algorithms for both Unique k-SAT and general k-SAT exhibit a running time behavior of 2^n(1-O(1/k))  (31, Vyas et al., 2019). This parallel in performance underscores the intrinsic difficulty of Unique k-SAT, despite its more constrained nature.\n\nThese findings collectively indicate that Unique k-SAT serves as a valuable proxy for studying general k-SAT. The uniqueness constraint, while seemingly restrictive, does not appear to significantly simplify the problem from a worst-case complexity perspective. Instead, it offers a potentially cleaner analytical framework for developing and understanding satisfiability algorithms, with insights and improvements often generalizing to the broader k-SAT domain.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This approach recognizes the inherent trade-off between these two aspects and seeks to find an optimal balance  (2, Bellini et al., 2017)  (89, Raza et al., 2020).\n\nResearchers typically employ a combination of metrics to assess recommendation performance. Accuracy metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE), and F-Measure are often used alongside diversity metrics to provide a comprehensive evaluation  (77, Wang et al., 2019). Common diversity metrics include coverage, personality, and those mentioned in the previous section  (103, Liu et al., 2020)  (65, Li et al., 2018).\n\nThe evaluation process often involves comparing the proposed diversity-optimizing method against baseline algorithms and state-of-the-art approaches. This comparison helps to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method in terms of both accuracy and diversity  (111, Ren et al., 2021)  (94, Ho et al., 2020). Some studies explicitly quantify the trade-off between different metrics, such as accuracy-coverage, accuracy-diversity, and accuracy-serendipity  (89, Raza et al., 2020).\n\nRecent approaches in diversity optimization aim to consider diversity directly when generating recommendations, developing more sophisticated models to achieve a better accuracy-diversity trade-off  (127, Laporte et al., 2021). These methods often demonstrate improvements in terms of the accuracy-diversity balance compared to traditional diversity enhancement techniques  (132, Gao et al., 2022).\n\nEvaluation is not limited to offline metrics alone. Some researchers conduct online A/B tests to demonstrate the real-world impact of their diversity-optimizing methods on both accuracy and diversity in live recommender systems  (99, Liu et al., 2020). Additionally, user studies are sometimes employed to assess how diversity improvements affect overall user satisfaction with recommendation lists, recognizing that quantitative metrics alone may not fully capture the user experience  (132, Gao et al., 2022).\n\nIn summary, the evaluation of new diversity-optimizing methods in recommendation systems typically involves a comprehensive assessment of both accuracy and diversity metrics, with a focus on understanding and optimizing the trade-off between these two crucial aspects of recommendation quality.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These assessments aim to measure the impact of diverse recommendations on user satisfaction, acceptance, and overall experience.\n\nThe evaluation of diversity-optimizing methods in recommendation systems has evolved to incorporate user-centric metrics and real-world user studies, recognizing that quantitative metrics alone may not fully capture the user experience. This approach aims to assess the impact of diverse recommendations on user satisfaction, acceptance, and overall experience with the system.\n\nUser-centric evaluations often involve conducting experiments with actual users of recommendation services. For instance, Nakajima et al. conducted user experiments to investigate the effect of recommendation algorithms specialized in increasing diversity, demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed system in diversifying recommendation lists and its impact on user experience  (156, Nakajima et al., 2024). Similarly, Wang et al. performed a real-time study to compare user satisfaction and acceptance with respect to diversified recommendations, providing insights into how users perceive and interact with more diverse content  (77, Wang et al., 2019).\n\nThe importance of user-centric metrics in evaluating recommendation diversity has been highlighted by several researchers. McNee et al. emphasized the significance of metrics that gauge different aspects of recommendation list quality, including content diversity  (101, Noordeh et al., 2020). This approach recognizes that diversity is a key factor in fulfilling user satisfaction  (144, Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nSome studies focus on modeling users' inclination towards selecting diverse items. Sciascio et al. proposed an approach to model users' diversity preferences based on content-based item attributes, with experimental evaluations proving the effectiveness of their method  (26, Sciascio et al., 2014). This type of research helps in tailoring diversity optimization to individual user preferences, potentially leading to more satisfying recommendations.\n\nIn addition to offline evaluations, online A/B tests are sometimes employed to assess the real-world impact of diversity-optimizing methods. Wang et al. conducted both offline and online evaluations to verify the significance of objective-level personalization in multi-objective recommendation scenarios  (113, Wang et al., 2021). These types of evaluations provide valuable insights into how diversity improvements affect user behavior and satisfaction in live recommendation systems.\n\nBy incorporating user satisfaction and experience assessments, researchers and practitioners can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how diversity-optimizing methods impact the overall quality and effectiveness of recommendation systems from the user's perspective.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These approaches leverage various sensor data and robot interactions to build robust traversability models.\n\nSelf-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for robots to autonomously learn terrain traversability costs from their own experiences. This method eliminates the need for manual labeling and allows robots to adapt to new environments more efficiently.\n\nOne notable example is the STERLING system, which learns terrain representations from unconstrained, unlabeled robot experiences  (14, Stone et al., 2023). STERLING uses self-supervised learning techniques to develop terrain representations and traversability costs, making it particularly relevant for autonomous navigation in unknown environments.\n\nCastro et al. proposed a method that combines exteroceptive environmental information with proprioceptive terrain interaction feedback to predict traversability costmaps in a self-supervised manner  (9, Castro et al., 2022). This approach has been validated on multiple large-scale navigation tasks using different all-terrain robots, demonstrating its effectiveness in challenging off-road terrains.\n\nA foundational work in this area is by Kim et al., who developed an online learning method for predicting traversability properties of complex terrain  (1, Kim et al., 2006). Their approach is based on the concept that traversability is an affordance jointly determined by the vehicle and its environment. By exploiting the robot's navigation experiences, they train classifiers without human intervention, making the system highly adaptable.\n\nRecent advancements include the use of kinodynamic models to estimate traction for rolling robots. Velasquez et al. introduced a self-supervised method that uses traction estimates from an online receding horizon estimator to train a traversability prediction neural network  (159, Velasquez et al., 2022). This approach eliminates the need for heuristics used in previous methods.\n\nAnother innovative approach is the BADGR system, which uses self-supervised offline reinforcement learning for mobile robot navigation  (160, Li et al., 2022). This system allows the network to learn traversability information directly from the robot's motion events, further enhancing its ability to adapt to new terrains.\n\nThese self-supervised learning approaches represent a significant advancement in enabling robots to autonomously learn and adapt to various terrain conditions, reducing the need for extensive pre-training or human intervention.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[33] designed a self-supervised offline reinforcement learning-based mobile robot navigation system called BADGR, allowing the network to learn traversability information from the robot's motion events.\n\n\n\nReinforcement Learning and Inverse Reinforcement Learning Methods\nTLDR: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods are being applied to learn terrain traversability costs from robot experiences and human demonstrations. These approaches enable robots to adapt to complex terrains and mimic specific navigation styles.\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL) and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) have emerged as powerful techniques for learning terrain traversability costs in robotics. These methods offer the advantage of learning directly from robot experiences or human demonstrations, allowing for more adaptive and nuanced navigation strategies.\n\nIRL has gained significant attention for modeling terrain traversability, particularly in autonomous vehicles  (11, Grizzle et al., 2022). Unlike traditional approaches that use predefined metrics, IRL aims to learn traversability costs directly from a robot's traversing behaviors. This method allows for a more flexible and context-aware understanding of terrain challenges.\n\nHuman demonstrations have been leveraged effectively in IRL approaches. Wigness et al. used maximum entropy IRL to learn local costmaps that enable robots to mimic specific human navigation styles  (93, Liu et al., 2020)  (97, Stone et al., 2020). For example, robots can be trained to maintain proximity to grass while traversing only road terrain, or to navigate covertly by staying close to building edges.\n\nIn the realm of RL, various algorithms have been applied to robot navigation on uneven terrains. Deterministic policies such as DDPG, A3C, and DQN with dense rewards have been incorporated for this purpose  (149, Chakraborty et al., 2022). These methods allow robots to learn optimal navigation strategies through trial and error in simulated or real environments.\n\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in training walking robots to traverse uneven terrain  (165, Wensing et al., 2022). However, challenges remain in ensuring that learned control policies are robust to neglected dynamics or unexpected terrain variations.\n\nRecent advancements include teacher/student training strategies that combine proprioceptive information, privileged learning, and algorithms like TRPO (Trust Region Policy Optimization)  (167, Zhang et al., 2022). These approaches have enabled quadruped robots like ANYmal to navigate challenging terrains successfully.\n\nWhile RL and IRL methods show great potential for learning terrain traversability, they often require significant computational resources and careful design of reward functions or demonstration data. Ongoing research aims to improve the efficiency and generalizability of these approaches to handle a wider range of terrain types and robot configurations.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods enable robots to adapt to changing environments and improve their navigation capabilities over time.\n\nOnline and incremental learning approaches have gained significant attention in robotics for learning terrain traversability costs. These methods allow robots to update their models in real-time as they encounter new terrains, making them particularly useful for long-term autonomous operation in dynamic environments.\n\nPr\u00e1gr et al. developed a robotic system that incrementally learns to predict power consumption-based traversal costs experienced by robots over various terrains (7, Pr\u00e1gr et al., 2019). This system combines autonomous spatial exploration with simultaneous learning of the underlying traversal cost model, enabling continuous adaptation to new terrain types.\n\nBuilding on this concept, Bayer et al. proposed a system for online and incremental learning of terrain traversal costs that are immediately utilized for navigation planning  (6, Bayer et al., 2019). Their approach uses incrementally constructed Gaussian Processes with a Bayesian Committee Machine to model traversal costs based on the robot's proprioceptive experiences and terrain descriptors.\n\nIn earlier work, Muller et al. and Burgard et al. introduced systems that use sparse traversability information from stereo modules to train classifiers online  (2, Muller et al., 2007)  (3, Burgard et al., 2008). These classifiers can predict the traversability of entire scenes, leveraging temporal and spatial concurrences to achieve view-invariant predictions.\n\nProcopio et al. developed a method for long-term learning in robot navigation by selecting a subset of previously learned linear binary classifiers  (23, Procopio et al., 2007). This approach enables robots to accumulate knowledge over time and apply it to new navigation tasks.\n\nBraun introduced a technique to learn consistent cost values from scratch based on feedback from the robot during operation  (39, Braun, 2011). This method allows for more flexible and autonomous robot operation, aligning with the trend towards appearance-based terrain traversability estimation methods.\n\nThese online and incremental learning techniques represent a significant advancement in enabling robots to continuously adapt their traversability models. By learning from real-time experiences, robots can improve their navigation capabilities in diverse and changing environments, making them more robust and versatile for long-term autonomous operation.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These approaches combine image processing, terrain classification, and robot experience to create adaptive traversability models.\n\nVision-based and proprioceptive learning methods have emerged as powerful tools for estimating terrain traversability in robotics. These approaches leverage visual data from cameras and proprioceptive feedback from the robot's sensors to create comprehensive traversability models.\n\nOne significant area of development is semantic segmentation of terrains using unsupervised learning techniques. These methods enable robots to reason about the possibility of traversing uneven terrains based on visual information  (5, Siva et al., 2019). This approach has been particularly useful for mobile robots navigating in unstructured environments.\n\nApprenticeship learning, also known as learning from demonstration or imitation learning, has been widely investigated to transfer human expertise in navigation control to autonomous robots  (5, Siva et al., 2019). This method allows robots to learn traversability costs directly from human demonstrations, creating a mapping from the representation space to the terrain costs encountered during traversal  (10, Konstantopoulos et al., 2022).\n\nFor multi-legged walking robots, researchers have developed methods to select suitable gaits based on terrain type. Bayer et al. implemented cost models as Gaussian Mixture regressors, providing certainty to identify unknown terrains where knowledge transfer is desirable  (13, Bayer et al., 2022). This approach allows robots to adapt their gait to different terrain conditions, enhancing their traversability capabilities.\n\nDeep learning techniques have also been applied to estimate traversability costs. Some works have adopted deep neural networks that learn local motion cost estimates from simulation, combining these estimators with variants of RRT for global path planning  (8, Yang et al., 2021). These methods enable robots to predict terrain negotiation based on images, which can then be used to plan movement and avoid high-cost terrains  (124, Nowicki et al., 2021).\n\nSelf-supervised online learning approaches have been developed to learn traversability costmaps for outdoor off-road robots using overhead imagery such as satellite images  (77, Valada et al., 2019). This method allows robots to adapt to new environments without requiring extensive pre-training.\n\nRecent research has focused on directly estimating continuous traversability costs, quantifying the difficulty of traversing particular terrains for wheeled or tracked robots  (190, Heckman et al., 2023). Some works have also proposed learning-based methods to compute foothold cost maps for legged robots, aiding in foothold selection  (155, Sartoretti et al., 2022).\n\nProprioceptive feedback has been incorporated into traversal cost learning models. By combining the robot's experienced traversal cost with terrain appearance and geometry captured by the robot's sensors, more comprehensive traversability models can be created (91, V\u00b4a\u02c7na et al., 2019).\n\nFor stereo vision-equipped robots, intelligent approaches have been developed to assess the traversability of the terrain in front of the robot  (43, Nalpantidis et al., 2012). These methods enable robots to automatically detect and avoid non-traversable areas, enhancing their autonomous navigation capabilities.\n\nSome researchers have explored using estimated terrain parameters as traversability cost functions in ground robot path planning applications  (57, Campbell et al., 2015). This approach allows for more nuanced path planning based on detailed terrain characteristics.\n\nOverall, vision-based and proprioceptive learning methods represent a significant advancement in terrain traversability estimation for robots. By combining visual data processing, terrain classification, and robot experience, these approaches enable more adaptive and robust navigation in complex environments.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Issues include instability at high Reynolds numbers, difficulties in capturing sharp transitions, and problems with error accumulation in time-dependent simulations.\n\nCombining neural networks with PDE solvers for fluid simulation presents several critical accuracy and stability challenges. One of the primary issues is the difficulty in achieving stable and accurate results for high Reynolds number flows  (104, Wang et al., 2023). PINNs (Physics-Informed Neural Networks) in particular struggle to yield accurate solutions for Reynolds numbers greater than 1,000, often becoming unstable and converging to erroneous solutions. This limitation severely restricts their applicability to complex fluid dynamics problems  (115, Karniadakis et al., 2023).\n\nAnother significant challenge lies in capturing sharp transitions and multiscale features in fluid flows. For instance, when simulating flow around airfoils, PINNs struggle to accurately represent the rapid acceleration near the leading edge  (151, Song et al., 2024). This difficulty extends to other scenarios where the flow exhibits high-frequency or multiscale structures, leading to a phenomenon known as 'spectral bias'  (156, Yang et al., 2024).\n\nThe stability of neural network-based models when coupled with fluid dynamics simulations is also a major concern. Brenowitz et al. note that neural network parameterizations often cause dramatic instability when integrated with atmospheric fluid dynamics, and the reasons for this instability are not fully understood  (20, Brenowitz et al., 2020). This lack of reliability hinders the widespread adoption of these techniques in climate modeling and other applications.\n\nTime-dependent simulations pose additional challenges, as errors can accumulate over time, leading to poor long-term predictions  (106, Lino et al., 2023). Even when neural networks accurately predict individual components or closure terms, they may still result in inaccurate trajectories when integrated into the full simulation  (1, Melchers et al., 0).\n\nOptimization and training of these hybrid models present their own set of difficulties. Issues such as numerical stiffness in training dynamics, challenges in selecting appropriate sampling points, and balancing different loss components all contribute to the overall complexity of the problem  (148, Zhou et al., 2024). Moreover, the performance of these models can be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, and there is still uncertainty surrounding which configurations perform best  (128, Toit et al., 2023).\n\nWhile progress has been made in addressing some of these challenges, significant work remains to be done. Researchers are actively exploring ways to improve the stability and accuracy of neural network-based fluid simulations, particularly for complex flows and high Reynolds number regimes  (152, Reinders et al., 2024). However, even with these ongoing efforts, the gap between neural network predictions and traditional numerical solutions remains substantial in many cases  (78, Dong et al., 2022).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Balancing model complexity with efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy is a key area of ongoing research.\n\nThe scalability and computational efficiency of neural network approaches in fluid simulation present substantial challenges. One of the primary issues is the difficulty in parameterizing inputs and outputs for complex computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems  (4, Umetani et al., 2018). This challenge becomes even more pronounced when attempting to extend machine learning methods to realistic fluid dynamics scenarios, requiring significant advancements in model architecture and training techniques  (26, Geneva et al., 2020).\n\nA major bottleneck in developing scalable algorithms for parametric surrogate CFD modeling is the lack of a posteriori error estimation and convergence theory. This limitation, coupled with the scarcity of training data for most parametric fluid dynamics problems, hinders the development of efficient deep neural network (DNN) based approaches  (55, Agrawal et al., 2021). The computational expense of generating large amounts of CFD data for training neural networks can be prohibitively high, potentially negating the time-saving benefits sought by incorporating neural networks in the first place  (32, Kempf et al., 2020).\n\nThe highly non-linear nature of the Navier-Stokes equations further complicates matters, making it challenging to propagate boundary information effectively through the network  (53, RaminBostanabad et al., 2021). This non-linearity, especially in 3D PDEs and turbulent flows, necessitates significant model complexity and a large number of parameters to accurately capture the intricate fluid dynamics  (138, Peng et al., 2023).\n\nFurthermore, computational and memory limitations often constrain the number of training parameters that can be employed. This issue is compounded by the black-box nature of neural networks, which do not inherently guarantee adherence to physical conservation laws and boundary conditions  (29, Chertkov et al., 2020). Balancing model complexity with computational efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy remains a key challenge in the field.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The black-box nature of NNs that do not guarantee physical conservation laws and boundary conditions (BCs).\n\n\n\nGeneralization and Adaptability\nTLDR: Neural networks in fluid simulations struggle to generalize to unseen flow conditions and maintain accuracy over long time scales. Challenges include high-dimensional parameter spaces, complex physics constraints, and the need for large amounts of training data.\n\nThe generalization and adaptability of neural network models in fluid simulations present significant challenges. One of the primary issues is the difficulty in extending trained models to accurately predict unseen flow conditions, especially in high-dimensional, physics-constrained scenarios  (14, Bode et al., 2019). This limitation is particularly evident in turbulence modeling, where machine learning-based closures struggle to generalize to practical flows outside their training domain  (57, Girimaji et al., 2021).\n\nThe complexity of fluid dynamics systems often requires neural networks to have more degrees of freedom than the original physical models they aim to approximate. This increased complexity is necessary even when the networks are trained on data covering the entire parameter space, highlighting the challenge of efficiently capturing the underlying physics  (57, Girimaji et al., 2021). The high-dimensional nature of realistic flows, coupled with stringent accuracy requirements, further complicates the generalization capabilities of these models  (14, Bode et al., 2019).\n\nA crucial challenge in adapting neural networks for fluid simulations lies in their long-term stability and accuracy. This is particularly evident in Large Eddy Simulation (LES) applications, where the goal is often to predict steady-state flow statistics. The question of whether a neural network-based model can remain stable and accurate over indefinite time horizons is non-trivial and remains an open research problem  (83, MacArt et al., 2022). This long-term stability issue is critical for practical applications, as many fluid dynamics problems require simulations over extended periods to capture relevant phenomena accurately.\n\nThe adaptability of neural network models to different flow regimes and boundary conditions also presents a significant challenge. The high sensitivity of fluid systems to initial and boundary conditions means that models trained on specific scenarios may not perform well when applied to even slightly different configurations [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. This lack of adaptability limits the practical utility of these models in real-world engineering applications, where flow conditions can vary widely.\n\nAddressing these generalization and adaptability challenges requires innovative approaches in model architecture, training strategies, and data generation. Researchers are exploring techniques such as physics-informed regularization, multi-fidelity training, and adaptive sampling to improve the robustness and transferability of neural network models in fluid simulations [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. However, significant work remains to be done to achieve the level of generalization and adaptability required for widespread adoption in complex fluid dynamics applications.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(14, Bode et al., 2019) | n_citations: 20 | Using Physics-Informed Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks for Subgrid Modeling in Turbulent Reactive Flows ]: \nReasons for this are the large amount of degrees of freedom in realistic flows, the high requirements with respect to accuracy and error robustness, as well as open questions, such as the generalization capability of trained neural networks in such high-dimensional, physics-constrained scenarios.\n\n2. [(57, Girimaji et al., 2021) | n_citations: 11 | Turbulence closure modeling with data-driven techniques: Investigation of generalizable deep neural networks ]: \nGeneralizability of machine-learning (ML) based turbulence closures to accurately predict unseen practical flows remains an important challenge... Even for this simple proxy-physics system, it is demonstrated that feed-forward NNs require more degrees of freedom than the original proxy-physics model to accurately approximate the true model even when trained with data over the entire parameter space (interpolation).\n\n3. [(83, MacArt et al., 2022) | n_citations: 8 | Deep learning closure models for large-eddy simulation of flows around bluff bodies ]: \nA crucial challenge is that the LES quantities of interest are the steady-state flow statistics... Calculating the steady-state flow statistics therefore requires simulating the DL-LES equations over a large number of flow times through the domain. It is a non-trivial question whether an unsteady PDE model with a functional form defined by a deep neural network can remain stable and accurate on $t \\in [0, \\infty )$\n\n\n\nInterpretability and Physical Consistency\nTLDR: Neural networks in fluid simulations face challenges in interpretability and maintaining physical consistency. These issues hinder widespread adoption and raise concerns about the reliability of predictions, especially for complex phenomena like turbulent flows.\n\nIntegrating neural networks with partial differential equation (PDE) or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers presents significant challenges in terms of interpretability and physical consistency  (111, Shankar et al., 2023). This lack of interpretability is a major barrier to the widespread adoption of neural network-based approaches in climate modeling and other fluid dynamics applications  (20, Brenowitz et al., 2020).\n\nOne of the key issues is the difficulty in understanding why neural network parameterizations often lead to dramatic instability when coupled with atmospheric fluid dynamics  (20, Brenowitz et al., 2020). This lack of understanding makes it challenging to ensure the reliability and physical consistency of the models, especially when dealing with complex phenomena such as turbulent flows  (130, Takac et al., 2023).\n\nThe problem is further complicated by the fact that some widely used PDEs, like the Navier-Stokes equations describing fluid motion, are not fully understood themselves  (122, Small, 2023). This underlying uncertainty in the governing equations adds another layer of complexity to the task of ensuring that neural network models maintain physical consistency.\n\nImproving the interpretability of machine learning models in CFD remains an open challenge  (130, Takac et al., 2023). While these models can be effective at simulating complex phenomena, their black-box nature makes it difficult to verify if they are capturing the correct physical principles or merely fitting to the training data. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the reliability of predictions, especially when extrapolating to new or unseen conditions.\n\nDeveloping more effective machine learning algorithms for modeling turbulent flow is a particularly pressing need in the field  (130, Takac et al., 2023). Turbulence is a notoriously challenging aspect of fluid dynamics, and ensuring that neural network models can accurately and consistently capture its behavior while adhering to physical laws is a significant open challenge.\n\nAddressing these issues of interpretability and physical consistency is crucial for building trust in neural network-based fluid simulation methods and enabling their wider adoption in scientific and engineering applications. Future research efforts need to focus on developing techniques that can provide insights into the decision-making processes of these models and ensure their predictions align with known physical principles.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Overcoming these limitations requires innovative approaches in network architecture, training techniques, and integration with traditional CFD methods.\n\nSimulating high Reynolds number and turbulent flows remains one of the most challenging areas for neural network-based approaches in fluid dynamics. The complexity of these flows, characterized by multiscale features and nonequilibrium dynamics, poses significant difficulties for existing neural network architectures  (44, Yuan et al., 2021). This challenge is particularly evident in three-dimensional turbulence, where accurate prediction remains a formidable task for neural networks  (77, Yuan et al., 2022).\n\nOne of the key issues is the inability of current neural network models to efficiently incorporate the multiscale and nonequilibrium characteristics of high Reynolds number turbulence into their design  (44, Yuan et al., 2021). This limitation often results in poor extrapolation capabilities and error accumulation in time-dependent simulations  (106, Lino et al., 2023). The problem is further exacerbated in two-dimensional flows, where the backscatter of energy from small to large scales presents additional challenges for neural network models  (64, Fablet et al., 2021).\n\nPhysics-informed neural networks (PINNs), while showing promise in general fluid flow prediction, struggle with high Reynolds number simulations. As the Reynolds number increases, the loss landscapes become increasingly rough, making it difficult for PINNs to capture the multiscale features of the flow accurately  (115, Karniadakis et al., 2023). This limitation is evident in studies where PINNs show significant errors in predicting velocity and pressure for turbulent flows  (128, Toit et al., 2023).\n\nThe lack of high-fidelity data for training and the stability issues in coupling neural network models with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers present additional bottlenecks in high Reynolds number scenarios  (80, Zhang et al., 2022). These challenges have led researchers to explore alternative approaches, such as using machine learning for specific flow problems where traditional CFD methods like RANS struggle, particularly in predicting separated flows (114, \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc58\u2217 et al., 2023).\n\nDespite these challenges, neural networks are showing potential in solving partial differential equations in various problem domains, including turbulent flow  (43, Li et al., 2021). However, significant work remains to make these approaches feasible for real-world applications  (76, Chuang et al., 2022). This includes improving the convergence properties of neural network learning for Navier-Stokes equations  (25, Wang et al., 2020) and developing more sophisticated network architectures and training methodologies tailored to the unique characteristics of high Reynolds number and turbulent flows.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These steps help to eliminate measurement errors and anomalous points that could negatively impact the surface reconstruction process. Additionally, point cloud simplification through downsampling or thinning is often necessary to manage computational complexity while preserving important geometric features  (81, Ye et al., 2022).\n\nNormal estimation is another crucial preprocessing step, as highlighted by  (16, Maierhofer et al., 2011). Accurate surface normals are essential for many surface reconstruction algorithms and can significantly influence the quality of the final result.\n\nSome researchers propose additional preprocessing steps. For instance,  (22, Xue, 2013) suggests deleting useless points, removing isolated points outside the main point cloud, and adding compensation points in blank areas of the point cloud data. These steps can help to improve the overall quality and completeness of the point cloud before surface reconstruction.\n\nIn summary, while the specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the nature of the point cloud data and the intended reconstruction method, denoising, outlier removal, downsampling, and normal estimation are consistently recognized as fundamental preprocessing operations for preparing point cloud datasets for surface reconstruction.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(22, Xue, 2013) | n_citations: 1 | Point Cloud Data Preprocessing Based on the Geomagic ]: \nSteps of point cloud data preprocessing include [3][4][5][6]: (1) delete useless point; (2) delete isolated point outside of the main point cloud in vitro; (3) filter speckles and error point noise; (4) resample point spacing according to the follow-up processing, (5) add compensation point in the blank of point cloud data.\n\n\n\nNoise Reduction and Outlier Removal\nTLDR: Noise reduction and outlier removal are critical preprocessing steps for point cloud data. These techniques improve data quality by eliminating measurement errors and anomalous points, which is essential for accurate surface reconstruction.\n\nNoise and outliers in point cloud data can significantly impact the quality of surface reconstruction. As  (42, Guerrero et al., 2019) emphasize, cleaning raw point clouds by discarding outlier samples and denoising the remaining points is typically the first stage of most geometry processing workflows. This step is crucial because, as  (8, Zhang et al., 2009) point out, accurate data consolidation from a noisy, unorganized raw point cloud is essential for correct surface reconstruction.\n\nVarious techniques have been developed to address noise and outliers in point cloud data.  (88, Zhang et al., 2023) mention that voxel filtering, statistical outlier filtering, and bilateral filtering are frequently used for point cloud denoising.  (84, Gou et al., 2023) propose a two-step approach, involving large-scale noise removal based on the relationship between local and global point cloud characteristics, followed by small-scale noise smoothing using normal cosine information entropy.\n\nThe importance of denoising in point cloud preprocessing is widely recognized  (75, Zhao, 2022)  (54, Ma et al., 2020).  (57, Tawfiq et al., 2020) stress that removing noisy data is essential for maintaining accurate representations of 3D scanned surfaces and preserving required geometrical features.\n\nSome researchers advocate for more comprehensive approaches.  (64, Joung et al., 2021) propose jointly solving tasks of densification, denoising, and completion of inaccurate point clouds, arguing that this leads to significant improvements in point cloud reconstruction.  (33, Govindu et al., 2016) present a robust method that not only removes outliers but also preserves fine-scale 3D features during the denoising process.\n\nThe order of preprocessing steps can also be important.  (86, Liu et al., 2023) suggest a sequence of removing outliers using statistical filtering, downsampling with an improved octree voxel filtering algorithm, and then smoothing and resampling the point cloud using the moving least squares method. They emphasize that smoothing and resampling should be done before reconstruction.\n\nUltimately, the goal of noise reduction and outlier removal is to produce clean, usable point cloud data. As  (7, Legrand et al., 2007) note, point clouds that have undergone proper filtering are free from artifacts and can be directly used in subsequent phases such as surface reconstruction.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(64, Joung et al., 2021) | n_citations: 14 | Deep Point Cloud Reconstruction ]: \nPoint cloud obtained from 3D scanning is often sparse, noisy, and irregular. To cope with these issues, recent studies have been separately conducted to densify, denoise, and complete inaccurate point cloud. In this paper, we advocate that jointly solving these tasks leads to significant improvement for point cloud reconstruction.\n\n9.

These techniques aim to create a compact, clean, and uniform representation of the point cloud while preserving important geometric features.\n\nPoint cloud simplification and sampling are crucial preprocessing steps for surface reconstruction, addressing the challenges of redundant, noisy, and non-uniform raw data  (77, Guo et al., 2022). These techniques aim to reduce the number of points while maintaining the overall structure and important features of the object.\n\nSeveral approaches have been proposed for point cloud simplification.  (1, Wang et al., 2014) introduce a pipeline that includes Poisson-disk sampling to simplify the point cloud data before normal estimation and surface reconstruction. This method helps in achieving a more uniform distribution of points, which can improve the quality of subsequent processing steps.\n\n (39, Luo et al., 2018) emphasize the importance of simplifying, smoothing, or re-sampling point clouds to enhance their quality before further geometric processing tasks, such as surface reconstruction. This preprocessing step can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of subsequent operations.\n\nAdvanced techniques for point cloud simplification have been developed to address specific challenges.  (77, Guo et al., 2022) propose a two-step approach that first learns a sampling matrix for feature-aware simplification, followed by a double-scale resampling module to refine the positions of sampled points, achieving a more uniform distribution.\n\nSome researchers combine simplification with other preprocessing steps.  (46, Guo et al., 2019) describe a three-step preprocessing approach that includes relocating each point, upsampling the point data, and optimizing normals to enhance features and geometric details. This comprehensive approach aims to improve the overall quality of the point cloud before surface reconstruction.\n\nThe importance of balancing accuracy and data reduction is highlighted by (50, Al-Bdairy et al., 2019), who stress the need to extract data points that reflect the surface shape while removing redundant information. This balance is crucial for maintaining the fidelity of the 3D model while improving processing efficiency.\n\nIn some cases, resampling techniques are used in conjunction with surface reconstruction methods.  (30, Luong et al., 2016) describe a fusion approach that involves resampling the point cloud using a surface reconstruction technique, which can help in creating a more consistent and reliable representation of the object's surface.\n\nBy implementing these point cloud simplification and sampling techniques, researchers and practitioners can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of their surface reconstruction workflows, ensuring that the input data is optimized for the subsequent reconstruction algorithms.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(77, Guo et al., 2022) | n_citations: 2 | Deep Point Cloud Simplification for High-quality Surface Reconstruction ]: \nRaw data is redundant, noisy, and non-uniform. Therefore, simplifying point clouds for achieving compact, clean, and uniform points is becoming increasingly important for 3D vision and graphics tasks...

Then we propose a novel double-scale resampling module to refine the positions of the sampled points, to achieve a uniform distribution.\n\n2.

Various methods are used to compute normal vectors, including local tangent plane construction, principal component analysis, and moment-based computations.\n\nNormal estimation is a crucial preprocessing step for point cloud datasets, playing a significant role in the quality of subsequent surface reconstruction  (8, Zhang et al., 2009). Accurate normal vectors are essential for many surface reconstruction algorithms, as they provide important information about the local geometry of the point cloud.\n\nSeveral approaches have been developed for normal estimation in point cloud data. Rumpf et al. propose a method based on the construction of local tangent planes and a local Delaunay triangulation of adjacent points projected onto this plane  (4, Rumpf et al., 2004). Their approach relies on moment-based computation, which offers proven scaling and stability properties, enhancing the reliability of the normal estimation process.\n\nMore recent research has focused on addressing challenges in complex surface models. Liu et al. highlight that the k-nearest neighborhoods (kNN) of feature points in complex surfaces are often isotropic, which can lead to blurring of sharp features during data processing  (56, Liu et al., 2020). To address this issue, they propose a method that combines KD tree construction, kNN calculation, and principal component analysis for feature point detection and normal vector estimation.\n\nThe importance of accurate normal estimation cannot be overstated in the context of surface reconstruction. Zhang et al. emphasize that data consolidation, particularly precise normal estimation from noisy, unorganized raw point clouds, is crucial for obtaining correct surface reconstructions  (8, Zhang et al., 2009). This underscores the need for robust normal estimation techniques as part of the preprocessing pipeline for point cloud data.\n\nBy implementing these normal estimation techniques as part of the preprocessing workflow, researchers and practitioners can significantly improve the quality of input data for surface reconstruction algorithms, leading to more accurate and reliable 3D model representations.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These techniques ensure that different point cloud segments are accurately combined into a cohesive whole, improving the overall quality of the data for surface reconstruction.\n\n- Point cloud registration is typically performed after initial preprocessing steps such as noise filtering and outlier removal  (68, Xiong et al., 2021).\n\n- Improved Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithms are commonly used for point cloud registration, helping to align multiple scans or datasets accurately  (85, Zheng et al., 2023).\n\n- A comprehensive preprocessing workflow may include removing discrete points, denoising, stitching, and registration before proceeding to surface reconstruction  (35, Wang et al., 2017).\n\n- Some approaches combine registration with other preprocessing techniques, such as using ICP real-time registration alongside Gaussian bilateral filtering for improved results  (35, Wang et al., 2017).\n\n- Registration and alignment are particularly important when dealing with large-scale or complex environments that require multiple scans to capture the entire scene [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n- Accurate registration ensures that features and geometries from different scans align properly, which is crucial for creating a coherent and accurate 3D model during surface reconstruction [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods include voxelization, upsampling, line segment cloud conversion, and targeted point removal for specific applications.\n\n- Voxelization and isosurface extraction:  (37, Schmidt et al., 2018) propose using a continuation method for voxelization and isosurface extraction of point clouds, which can help in creating a volumetric representation of the data.\n\n- Hierarchical multiresolution representation:  (3, Hansen et al., 2003) suggest presmoothing data sets, extracting isosurfaces, and then applying a surface-growing algorithm to generate a hierarchical multiresolution representation of the isosurface.\n\n- Point cloud upsampling:  (73, Wang et al., 2022) highlight that point cloud upsampling can densify sparse point clouds, recovering more geometric details and benefiting downstream surface reconstruction.\n\n- Line segment cloud conversion:  (52, Walecki et al., 2020) introduce the concept of line segment clouds and propose an iterative line segment tightening algorithm to convert these into point clouds as a preprocessing step.\n\n- Targeted point removal: (5, Peng-nan, 2006) and  (59, Bulatov et al., 2020) suggest removing points that don't belong to the surface of interest, such as those representing trees in certain applications.\n\n- Kernel density estimation:  (27, Brophy, 2015) utilizes kernel density estimation with variable bandwidths to obtain a probability density function over the space of observed points, which can be more discriminative than classical distance-based metrics.\n\n- Poisson surface reconstruction:  (17, Ma et al., 2011) and  (21, Weifeng et al., 2013) recommend using Poisson surface reconstruction for noisy and irregular point cloud data without normal vector information, followed by manual correction if necessary.\n\n- Comprehensive preprocessing pipeline:  (35, Wang et al., 2017) describe a multi-step process including discrete point removal, denoising, stitching, registration, and triangular mesh generation using various algorithms like Gaussian bilateral filtering and ICP real-time registration.\n\n- Surface smoothing:  (49, Kumar et al., 2019) emphasize the importance of generating smooth surfaces from point cloud data as part of the 3D surface reconstruction pipeline.\n\nReferences:\n1.

It significantly impacts model performance and interpretation, making it a fundamental consideration for researchers and practitioners.\n\nDetermining the appropriate number of topics is widely recognized as a crucial and persistent challenge in topic modeling  (2, Cunningham et al., 2014)  (10, Doss et al., 2019). This fundamental issue affects the latent dimension of a corpus and directly influences the quality and interpretability of the resulting model  (15, Vangara et al., 2020). Researchers consistently face the difficulty of deciding on the optimal number of topics in advance, which can significantly impact the effectiveness of their analyses  (7, Rahman et al., 2018). The importance of this selection process is underscored by its direct relationship to the overall performance and utility of topic models  (22, Ruiz et al., 2023). Moreover, the choice of topic number is intrinsically linked to the evaluation of topic model quality, making it a longstanding challenge that requires careful consideration and robust methodologies  (23, Pan et al., 2023). Given its critical role in shaping the outcomes of topic modeling, selecting the right number of topics remains a key focus for researchers seeking to improve the accuracy and reliability of their models.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods aim to balance efficiency, accuracy, and practicality in determining the ideal number of topics for a given corpus.\n\n1. Comprehensive evaluation: Some advanced methods, like the one proposed by Gan et al., construct a comprehensive index to effectively judge the optimal number of topics in LDA models. This approach provides multiple advantages, including good predictive ability, high isolation between topics, no duplicate topics, and repeatability  (1, Gan et al., 2021).\n\n2. Efficiency: Optimal topic selection methods can be more time-efficient compared to traditional approaches. For instance, the method described by Gan et al. takes less time than perplexity and coherence methods when selecting the topic number for the original LDA model  (1, Gan et al., 2021).\n\n3. Adaptability to large datasets: Some modern approaches are designed to handle big data more effectively. Unlike conventional methods that rely on repeated runs of inference algorithms to search through a large range of parameter values, newer techniques aim to be more suitable for mining big data  (3, Tang et al., 2014).\n\n4. Intuitive parameter selection: Advanced methods strive to replace hard-to-determine parameters with more intuitive ones. This addresses a limitation of some Bayesian nonparametric models, which may introduce alternative parameters that are less intuitive and still challenging to determine  (3, Tang et al., 2014).\n\n5. Reduced need for manual intervention: By providing more automated and robust ways to select the optimal number of topics, these methods can reduce the need for manual tuning and expert intervention in the topic modeling process [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1.

Existing methods often struggle with efficiency, scalability, and intuitive parameter selection, particularly for large datasets.\n\nDetermining the appropriate number of topics remains a fundamental challenge in topic modeling, significantly affecting the effectiveness and interpretability of the resulting models  (2, Cunningham et al., 2014)  (15, Vangara et al., 2020). This challenge is particularly acute as researchers must often decide on the number of topics in advance, without a clear understanding of the underlying structure of their data  (7, Rahman et al., 2018). The consequences of selecting an inappropriate number of topics can be severe; an insufficient number may result in a model that is too coarse to accurately distinguish between topics, while too many topics can lead to overfitting and reduced interpretability  (11, Wang et al., 2019).\n\nConventional methods for automatic topic number selection, such as cross-validation, AIC, or BIC, often rely on repeated runs of inference algorithms across a wide range of parameter values. This approach becomes increasingly impractical for large datasets, limiting its applicability in the era of big data  (3, Tang et al., 2014). Moreover, some advanced techniques, like Bayesian nonparametric models, attempt to address this issue but introduce new challenges by replacing familiar parameters with less intuitive alternatives that are still difficult to determine  (3, Tang et al., 2014).\n\nThe persistent nature of this challenge underscores the need for more robust, efficient, and intuitive methods for selecting the optimal number of topics. As the field of topic modeling continues to evolve, addressing this fundamental issue remains crucial for improving the overall quality and utility of topic models across various domains and dataset sizes.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods either rely on repeated runs of the inference algorithm to search through a large range of parameter values which does not suit the mining of big data, or replace this parameter with alternative parameters that are less intuitive and still hard to be determined.\n\n\n\nImpact of topic number on model performance\nTLDR: The number of topics chosen significantly affects the quality and interpretability of topic models. While too few topics can lead to overly broad categories, too many can result in less coherent and meaningful topics, highlighting the importance of finding the optimal balance.\n\nThe selection of the appropriate number of topics is a critical factor that directly influences the performance and effectiveness of topic modeling approaches  (21, Jiang et al., 2023)  (11, Wang et al., 2019). This choice has far-reaching implications on how a corpus is structured and interpreted  (4, Perkins et al., 2015). When an insufficient number of topics is chosen, the resulting model may be too coarse, failing to accurately distinguish between different themes within the corpus  (11, Wang et al., 2019). Conversely, selecting too many topics can lead to decreased topic coherence and overall quality of the uncovered topics, particularly in long-text scenarios  (14, Albalawi et al., 2020).\n\nThe impact of topic number on model performance is not uniform across all topic modeling techniques. For instance, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Pachinko Allocation Model (PAM) have demonstrated stronger performance in extracting topics when working with a lower range of generated topics compared to other methods like Dirichlet Multinomial Regression (DMR)  (18, Leist et al., 2021). This suggests that different algorithms may have varying sensitivities to the number of topics chosen.\n\nEmpirical studies have shown that increasing the number of topics does not always lead to better results. For example, in one study, LDA models with 60 topics produced a larger number of less meaningful topics compared to models with 40 topics, where themes were more discernible and salient  (4, Perkins et al., 2015). This observation underscores the delicate balance required in topic selection to optimize model performance and interpretability.\n\nGiven the significant impact of topic number on the final results and quality of topic extraction  (21, Jiang et al., 2023), it is clear that finding the optimal number of topics remains a crucial challenge in topic modeling. The performance implications of this choice highlight the need for robust methods to determine the ideal number of topics, tailored to the specific characteristics of the corpus and the goals of the analysis.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These include self-citation, citation cartels, coercive citation, and manipulating publication practices.\n\n- Self-citation: One of the most common and easiest methods to inflate citation metrics is excessive self-citation by authors  (4, Nandi et al., 2018)  (5, Chakraborty et al., 2020). This practice can be used to strategically manipulate the h-index by citing papers that are close to increasing the index  (8, Bartneck et al., 2010).\n\n- Citation cartels: Groups of researchers or journals may form \"citation cartels\" to artificially boost each other's citation counts  (39, Jain et al., 2019).\n\n- Coercive citation: Editors may pressure authors to cite articles from their journals during the review process, artificially inflating the journal's impact factor  (7, Takeda et al., 2009).\n\n- Honorary authorship: Adding authors who contributed little or nothing to a paper can inflate individual citation metrics  (5, Chakraborty et al., 2020).\n\n- Salami publishing: Breaking research into multiple smaller publications to increase citation counts  (17, Haustein, 2016).\n\n- Citation padding: Scholars may cite each other's work excessively to boost their citation numbers  (38, Baykoucheva, 2019).\n\n- Secondary or tertiary citing: Authors may copy citations from other papers without reading the original sources  (28, Iyengar et al., 2017).\n\n- Journal self-citation: Journals may encourage or require authors to cite other articles from the same journal to inflate its impact factor  (18, Heneberg, 2016).\n\n- Ceremonial citations: Authors may include citations to friends, colleagues, or eminent figures in the field without scholarly justification  (28, Iyengar et al., 2017).\n\n- Avoiding competitor citations: Researchers may deliberately avoid citing work from competitors  (38, Baykoucheva, 2019).\n\n- Self-plagiarism: Authors may reuse their own previously published work without proper attribution  (21, Coulthard, 2016).\n\nThese manipulation techniques can significantly impact citation-based metrics, potentially distorting the perceived impact and importance of research outputs  (40, Gagolewski et al., 2019). The widespread use of such practices has led to concerns about the validity and reliability of citation-based indicators in evaluating research quality and impact  (16, Smaldino et al., 2016).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These experiments reveal the vulnerability of citation-based metrics to deliberate manipulation.\n\nMultiple studies have provided concrete evidence of how citation metrics can be manipulated, raising concerns about their reliability as measures of research impact. One notable experiment by Robinson-Garcia et al. showed how easily Google Scholar's citation counts could be inflated. They uploaded six fictitious documents referencing publications from their research group, resulting in a significant increase in citations for the referenced authors (2, Robinson-Garcia et al., 2013). Similarly, Torres-Salinas et al. demonstrated an increase of 774 citations across 129 papers, boosting both author and journal h-indices (1, Torres-Salinas et al., 2012).\n\nThe manipulation of Google Scholar metrics has been further documented by several researchers. Gipp et al. successfully increased the rankings of academic articles on Google Scholar by manipulating citation counts through fake papers  (9, Gipp et al., 2010). Jacs\u00f3 reported on experiments where researchers added invisible words to conference papers and modified published papers' content and bibliographies to improve their ranking and citation counts (10, Jacs\u00f3, 2011).\n\nMore sophisticated techniques have also been uncovered. Labb\u00e9 et al. found evidence of citation manipulation using edited SCIgen bibliographies, where fraudsters published nonsensical algorithmically generated papers featuring genuine references (52, Labb\u00e9 et al., 2021). Wren et al. identified a \"fingerprint\" of citation hacking, characterized by large blocks of contiguous citations to a researcher within a single paper  (58, Wren et al., 2022).\n\nThe h-index, despite being proposed as less susceptible to manipulation, has also been shown to be vulnerable. Bartneck and Kokkelmans discussed how authors could inflate their h-index through self-citation  (46, Bera et al., 2020). Pavlou et al. demonstrated that merging articles with similar citation counts could artificially increase an author's h-index  (23, Pavlou et al., 2016).\n\nThese manipulations are not limited to individual researchers. Bhat et al. revealed that misrepresenting citations due to wrong indexing of author names can lead to increased citation counts and affect author rankings  (62, Bhat et al., 2023). Additionally, Magazinov et al. noted that highly cited researchers have been banned from editorial boards due to unethical practices of trading citations for manuscript acceptance  (6, Magazinov et al., 2023).\n\nThe ease of manipulating citation metrics has been further highlighted by experiments like that of Thiede, who created a fictitious highly-cited author named Ike Antkare using computer-generated papers  (29, Thiede, 2017). These findings collectively demonstrate the vulnerability of citation-based metrics to deliberate manipulation, raising serious questions about their validity as measures of research impact and quality.\n\nReferences:\n1.

It is not that Antkare is from an obscure discipline. This aberration is the result of a vulnerability of citation analyses. A vulnerability proven with a computer program.\n\n\n\nPrevalence and Impact of Citation Gaming\nTLDR: Citation gaming techniques are widespread in academic publishing, affecting journal impact factors, individual researcher metrics, and overall scientific credibility. The prevalence of these practices has led to concerns about the reliability of citation-based metrics and their impact on research evaluation.\n\nThe prevalence of citation gaming in academic publishing is a growing concern, with evidence suggesting it is more widespread than previously thought. Journals, under pressure to improve their impact factors, have been found to engage in questionable practices. Livan et al. revealed that many journals' Journal Impact Factors (JIFs) are significantly boosted by citations from a small group of other journals  (42, Livan et al., 2020). This finding is corroborated by Kojaku et al., who noted the widespread presence of journals whose JIFs are substantially inflated by citations from a select group of other publications  (47, Kojaku et al., 2020).\n\nThe impact of these practices extends beyond just journal metrics. Researchers themselves are increasingly engaging in citation manipulation to boost their individual metrics. Singh observed that some academics attempt to manipulate their document count, citation numbers, and h-index by misusing their positions of power  (57, Singh, 2022). This behavior is not limited to a few bad actors; Nazarovets noted that in Ukraine, where Scopus data is used for academic evaluation, authors deliberately resort to fraud by publishing in delisted journals to inflate their metrics  (56, Nazarovets, 2022).\n\nThe methods of citation gaming are diverse and often sophisticated. Ausloos et al. identified self-citations, citation cartels, and coercive citations as common techniques that can bias citation metrics  (59, Ausloos et al., 2022). Yu et al. developed methods to identify \"abnormal journals\" suspected of manipulating their self-citations  (11, Yu et al., 2011), while Chadegani et al. found that journals with lower impact factors are more likely to engage in coercive citation practices  (13, Chadegani et al., 2013).\n\nThe consequences of these practices are far-reaching. Park et al. argued that the concentration of citations in prestigious journals could exacerbate citation polarization, potentially worsening the divide in academic publishing  (61, Park et al., 2023). This polarization can lead to a situation where citations are based more on journal visibility than on the significance of the work itself.\n\nThe prevalence of citation gaming has raised serious questions about the validity of citation-based metrics in evaluating research quality and impact. Shah et al. emphasized the importance of developing impact metrics that are robust and difficult to manipulate  (15, Shah et al., 2015). However, as Davis pointed out, detecting citation cartels and other forms of gaming remains extremely challenging  (35, Davis, 2018).\n\nThe impact of citation gaming extends beyond individual researchers and journals, affecting the integrity of the scientific process itself. Hassan et al. noted how self-citations can prop up fraudulent research, allowing retracted studies to continue being cited for decades  (26, Hassan et al., 2017). This highlights the long-term consequences of citation manipulation on scientific credibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence suggests that citation gaming is a pervasive issue in academic publishing, with wide-ranging impacts on research evaluation, career advancement, and the overall integrity of scientific communication. The prevalence of these practices underscores the need for more robust evaluation methods and increased vigilance in detecting and addressing citation manipulation.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This shift has particularly benefited researchers in developing countries, increased the visibility and use of research outputs, and transformed the scholarly communication process.\n\nOpen access (OA) publishing has dramatically altered the landscape of academic publishing, making research outputs freely available to readers worldwide (49, Bar-Anan et al., 2012). This model, which funds publishing through publication fees rather than reader subscriptions, has emerged as a cost-effective option for disseminating scholarly research  (21, Johnson, 2005). The global impact of OA publishing has been significant, particularly in addressing the issue of inaccessibility due to financial constraints in developing countries  (32, Ghosh et al., 2007).\n\nOne of the most notable effects of OA publishing is the increased visibility and use of scholarly articles worldwide  (92, Kitas et al., 2019). This increased accessibility has led to a higher likelihood of OA articles being cited, with one study finding that OA articles are approximately 64.7% more likely to be cited on Wikipedia compared to closed-access articles  (121, West et al., 2023). The impact extends beyond academia, as OA enables a wider audience, including policymakers and practitioners, to access and utilize research findings  (55, Wellen, 2013).\n\nFor researchers in developing countries, OA publishing has been particularly transformative. It has allowed their work to reach global research communities more easily and has provided them with access to a wealth of international research  (9, Arunachalam, 2003). This democratization of knowledge has been facilitated by the internet and open-source software, which have significantly reduced publishing and distribution costs  (42, Willinsky et al., 2010).\n\nThe OA movement has also influenced the quality and credibility of scholarly journals. Many successful OA journals have emerged, demonstrating that open digital repositories can enhance the quality and citability of research outputs  (54, Gasparyan et al., 2013). This shift has led to a reevaluation of traditional publishing paradigms, with the potential to turn the world's research literature into a global resource accessible to everyone over the internet  (24, Hey et al., 2005).\n\nThe adoption of OA publishing has been growing steadily. A report from the UK indicates a substantial rise in journals worldwide offering an immediate OA option, from under 50% in 2012 to just over 60% in 2016  (111, Jurchen et al., 2020). This trend is expected to continue as more publishers promote OA through policy changes, special initiatives, and transformative agreements  (124, Mi, 2024).\n\nIn conclusion, the global impact of OA publishing has been profound, fundamentally altering the conditions of knowledge production and distribution  (37, Armbruster, 2008). It has widened the impact of academic work, reformed scholarly publishing markets, and helped alleviate some cost pressures in academia  (55, Wellen, 2013). As the OA movement continues to evolve, it promises to further transform the process of scholarly communication, bringing significant benefits to the academic world and society at large  (29, McCulloch, 2006).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These innovations have made open access publishing more feasible and accessible to a wider range of publishers and researchers globally.\n\nThe rise of open access (OA) publishing has been largely facilitated by technological advancements, particularly the widespread adoption of the internet and the development of open-source software. These innovations have significantly reduced the costs and barriers associated with academic publishing, making it possible for a diverse range of entities to participate in scholarly communication (16, Bj\u00f6rk et al., 2004)  (66, Solomon, 2014).\n\nDigital technologies have transformed the entire academic publishing process, from writing and peer review to dissemination and preservation  (106, Paltridge, 2020). The shift away from print-based publishing to digital formats has questioned traditional publishing models, with even established publishers moving towards digital-first approaches  (118, Piotrowski et al., 2022).\n\nOpen-source publishing platforms have played a crucial role in democratizing academic publishing. One notable example is the Open Journal Systems (OJS), developed by the Public Knowledge Project. OJS is freely available software that enables journals and scholarly societies to consider publishing on an open access basis, which has been shown to dramatically increase readership  (13, Willinsky, 2003). The adoption of such platforms has been particularly impactful in regions like Ibero-America, where they have contributed to increased visibility and access for local journals (43, Alonso-Gamboa et al., 2010).\n\nThe internet has not only facilitated traditional journal publishing but has also enabled alternative models of scholarly communication. Researchers now have the ability to disseminate various versions of their manuscripts through web-based services, complementing the primary channel of OA journals  (110, Shen, 2020). This has led to the emergence of new publishing models, including pre-publication servers and innovative business approaches like PeerJ's membership fee model  (69, Hunter, 2015).\n\nThe impact of these technological advancements on the global distribution of academic publishing has been significant. For instance, when Oxford University Press moved its prestigious journal Nucleic Acids Research to a full OA model in 2005, it experienced a 143% increase in use, largely driven by improved discoverability through search engines  (33, HUNTINGTON et al., 2007). This demonstrates the potential of OA publishing to increase the visibility and impact of research globally.\n\nAs of 2018, the Public Knowledge Project's software was supporting over 10,000 journals worldwide, illustrating the widespread adoption of open-source publishing tools  (83, Alperin et al., 2018). These technological advancements have made OA publishing a viable option for more journals, potentially increasing their readership and global impact  (48, Senso, 2011).\n\nIn conclusion, technological advancements have been instrumental in enabling and promoting open access publishing. By reducing costs, streamlining processes, and providing accessible tools, these innovations have transformed the landscape of academic publishing, making it more inclusive and globally accessible.\n\nReferences:\n1.

While Western nations have traditionally led OA initiatives, emerging economies are showing rapid growth in OA publishing, challenging conventional assumptions about the global distribution of academic research.\n\nThe adoption of Open Access (OA) publishing has shown notable regional differences, often contradicting expectations based on economic development. Contrary to the general belief that OA adoption tracks with development and that Western countries lead the movement, research has revealed a strong negative correlation between a country's per capita income and its percentage of OA publications  (91, Iyandemye et al., 2019). This surprising trend suggests that developing countries may be embracing OA more readily than their wealthier counterparts.\n\nEmerging economies such as Brazil, India, and China have been particularly active in promoting OA publishing, demonstrating a significant increase in both the number and proportion of OA publications between 2006 and 2014  (70, Li et al., 2015). This shift is partly attributed to the potential of OA to increase the international visibility of journals from periphery or semi-periphery countries  (108, Macan et al., 2020).\n\nFor developing nations, OA presents a valuable opportunity to make their research output more accessible to the global scientific community. Institutional repositories, in particular, have been identified as a means for researchers in these countries to publish their work using servers anywhere in the world, potentially increasing the impact and reach of their scholarship  (44, Librarian et al., 2010). Some African scholars view the OA movement as a beneficial development that can enhance the dissemination of scientific articles from their region  (25, Nwagwu, 2005).\n\nHowever, regional differences in OA adoption are not solely determined by economic factors. Policy initiatives also play a crucial role. Many North American, European, and other countries have passed laws requiring open access to articles and data from federally funded research, further driving OA adoption in these regions  (88, Ranasinghe et al., 2018). Such policies have contributed to the global expansion of OA awareness and implementation.\n\nThe impact of OA on regional academic publishing is evident in various contexts. For example, in Jordan, the adoption of e-publishing for academic journals has enabled them to reach new readers and attract papers from around the world more easily and cost-effectively than ever before (76, Al-Shboul, 2016). This demonstrates how OA can help bridge geographical divides in academic publishing.\n\nDespite these positive trends, challenges remain in the global landscape of OA adoption. The dominance of established leading journals, often based in Western countries, faces increasing pressure from the OA movement  (59, Carey, 2013). This tension highlights the ongoing transformation of the academic publishing ecosystem and the potential for OA to redistribute influence in the global research community.\n\nIn conclusion, while regional differences in OA adoption persist, the trend appears to be moving towards greater global equity in academic publishing. The unexpected leadership of some developing countries in OA adoption, combined with policy initiatives in developed nations, suggests a shifting landscape that may ultimately lead to a more diverse and inclusive global academic publishing environment.\n\nReferences:\n1.

However, the dominance of established leading journals faces a defining moment under the steady pressure of the open access movement.\n\n\n\nChallenges and Criticisms of Open Access\nTLDR: Open Access publishing faces several challenges, including concerns about article quality, financial sustainability, and equity issues. Critics argue that the author-pays model may incentivize quantity over quality and create new barriers for researchers from less-funded institutions or developing countries.\n\n1. Quality Concerns: One of the primary criticisms of Open Access (OA) publishing is the potential compromise on article quality. The author-pays model in OA publishing creates a strong incentive for publishers to accept papers regardless of their quality, as more publications translate to more revenue. This raises concerns that OA publications could essentially become paid advertisements rather than rigorously vetted scientific contributions  (86, Hunter, 2018).\n\n2. Financial Sustainability: The transition to OA publishing has led to questions about the financial viability of this model for academic journals. Research has shown that journal quality affects the profitability of adopting open access, suggesting that not all journals may benefit equally from this shift  (73, Snyder et al., 2016).\n\n3. Equity Issues: While OA aims to increase access to research, it may inadvertently create new barriers. The current academic publishing model is criticized for being inequitable, with commercial publishers demanding exorbitant prices for access to journal articles, either through subscriptions or article processing charges (APCs). This can be particularly burdensome for researchers from less-funded institutions or developing countries  (117, Koley et al., 2022).\n\n4. Proliferation of Predatory Journals: The rapid growth of OA journals has led to an increase in potentially predatory or low-quality publications. In the field of educational technology alone, nearly one-third of an estimated 270 associated journals are designated as open. While this growth contributes to reducing subscription barriers, it has also raised suspicions about the credibility and quality of some OA journals  (74, Perkins et al., 2016).\n\n5. Sustainability of Traditional Publishing Models: The shift towards OA publishing challenges the sustainability of traditional subscription-based journals. This transition may lead to a restructuring of the academic publishing industry, potentially affecting long-established journals and publishers [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n6. Peer Review Process: There are concerns about maintaining the integrity and thoroughness of the peer review process in OA journals, especially those operating on tight budgets or with rapid publication timelines [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1. [(86, Hunter, 2018) | n_citations: 6 | A DEAL for open access ]: \nAn author's payment for publication in the current open access model creates a strong incentive for publishers to accept papers independent of their quality, elevating the risk that publications become paid advertisements.\n\n2. [(73, Snyder et al., 2016) | n_citations: 37 | Open Access as a Crude Solution to a Hold\u2010Up Problem in the Two\u2010Sided Market for Academic Journals ]: \nPrevious research modeled academic journals as platforms connecting authors with readers in a two-sided market... we focus on a key difference between the market for academic journals and these other markets: journals vary in terms of quality... we examine (a) whether open-access journals would tend to publish more articles than traditional journals... (b) whether journal quality affects the profitability of adopting open access\n\n3. [(117, Koley et al., 2022) | n_citations: 3 | Digital platform for open and equitable sharing of scholarly knowledge in India ]: \nThe academic publishing model is very inequitable currently \u2013 most commercial publishers demand exorbitant prices for access to journal articles, either through subscription or article processing charges. In this digital era, when publishing costs are negligible, and the peer review process is voluntary, it is unreasonable to have such high access barriers.\n\n4. [(74, Perkins et al., 2016) | n_citations: 9 | Open access journals in educational technology: Results of a survey of experienced users ]: \nAs the academic publishing industry evolves, there has been an unprecedented growth of open access journals (OAJs). In educational technology alone, with an estimated 270 associated journals, nearly one-third are designated as open. Though OAJs are lauded for what their availability can contribute to social justice issues (reduction of subscription requirement barriers), some remain suspicious\n\n\n\nFuture Trends and Innovations in Open Access Publishing\nTLDR: Future trends in Open Access publishing include the adoption of blockchain technology for decentralized publishing platforms and the development of institutional repositories. These innovations aim to empower authors, increase transparency, and provide more equitable access to research globally.\n\nThe future of Open Access (OA) publishing is likely to be shaped by technological innovations and evolving publishing models. One significant trend is the exploration of blockchain technology to create decentralized publishing platforms. Projects like Paperchain and PubChain aim to empower authors by giving them full ownership of their work and finances, while also incentivizing meaningful participation from readers and reviewers  (115, Gupta et al., 2021)  (94, Zhang et al., 2019). These platforms could potentially address issues of transparency and equity in academic publishing.\n\nAnother important development is the growing emphasis on institutional repositories (IRs). IRs offer academic libraries a way to provide more OA resources to their communities by collecting, storing, and providing access to an institution's research output  (101, Iddriss et al., 2019). This approach can be particularly beneficial for developing countries, as it provides an economical solution for sharing research globally.\n\nThe future of OA publishing is also likely to involve a diversification of publishing models. While major international commercial publishers currently dominate the landscape, the advancement of OA requires the adoption of gold, hybrid, and green OA publishing models by a variety of smaller journal and book publishers operating in both international and national contexts (105, P\u00f6l\u00f6nen et al., 2020). This diversification could lead to a more balanced and inclusive academic publishing ecosystem.\n\nInnovative approaches to peer review and certification processes are also emerging. For example, China's Science Paper Online platform uses transparent post-publication peer-review processes to encourage innovation and address systemic problems in traditional academic publishing  (60, REN, 2013). Such approaches could become more widespread, potentially transforming how research quality is assessed and certified.\n\nTo address the challenges of increasing submission volumes and the need for public access to publicly funded research, future trends may include the expansion of public repositories and collective agreements with publishers  (113, Politi et al., 2021). These strategies could help balance the demands for open access with the need for sustainable publishing models.\n\nIn conclusion, the future of OA publishing is likely to be characterized by technological innovations, diversification of publishing models, and new approaches to peer review and research dissemination. These trends aim to create a more equitable, transparent, and efficient global academic publishing landscape.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These tools act as catalysts for creativity and innovation, potentially broadening the scope of scientific exploration.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have the potential to significantly enhance the diversity of published scientific ideas through various mechanisms. One key advantage is their ability to foster interdisciplinary work by bridging knowledge gaps across scientific fields  (26, Veiga et al., 2023). This cross-pollination of ideas can lead to novel research approaches and perspectives that might not have emerged otherwise.\n\nLLMs can also stimulate creativity and idea generation in scientific research. ChatGPT, for instance, can play diverse roles in brainstorming, from stimulating creativity for new idea generation to providing suggestions for expanding existing ideas  (6, Lee et al., 2023). This capability can help researchers identify gaps in existing literature and develop new hypotheses  (21, Karakose, 2023), potentially leading to more diverse and innovative research directions.\n\nFurthermore, these AI tools can enhance the accessibility and dissemination of scientific knowledge. LLMs can efficiently generate texts for diverse audiences, facilitating science communication and public education  (26, Veiga et al., 2023). They can also assist in translating scientific articles into multiple languages, expanding the reach of research to a global audience  (26, Veiga et al., 2023). This increased accessibility could lead to a more diverse pool of researchers and ideas entering the scientific discourse.\n\nLLMs like ChatGPT can also accelerate the innovation process in scientific research  (27, Sarwar et al., 2023). By quickly summarizing literature, composing essays, and even producing statistical studies, these tools can free up researchers' time for more creative and analytical tasks. Advanced AI models like GPT-4 allow for deeper understanding of existing research and can help identify gaps in the literature, promoting innovative research approaches  (43, Baradziej, 2023).\n\nIt's important to note that while LLMs have significant potential to enhance scientific diversity, they should be viewed as tools that empower human creativity rather than replace it. As demonstrated in a thought experiment using ChatGPT, these AI models can act as catalysts for expanded intellectual exploration and discovery, helping researchers delve deeper into their own ideas  (19, Adesso, 2023).\n\nHowever, the scientific community must continue to debate and envision the consequences of using such technology to ensure its positive impact on scientific diversity  (27, Sarwar et al., 2023). Balancing the benefits of AI assistance with human creativity and critical thinking will be crucial in maximizing the positive impacts of LLMs on the diversity of published scientific ideas.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Rather than replacing human creativity, ChatGPT empowers us to delve deeper into the treasures of our own minds, acting as a catalyst for expanded intellectual exploration and discovery.\n\n\n\nPotential negative impacts on scientific diversity\nTLDR: Large language models like ChatGPT may inadvertently reduce scientific diversity by amplifying existing biases, homogenizing ideas, and potentially leading to new forms of academic misconduct. These issues could result in a narrowing of scientific perspectives and a concentration of attention on already popular research.\n\nWhile large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT offer numerous benefits to scientific research, they also pose potential threats to the diversity of published scientific ideas. One significant concern is the amplification of existing biases in scientific literature. ChatGPT tends to cite highly cited publications, which can contribute to the Matthew Effect in science, where already popular papers receive even more attention, widening the gap between highly cited and lesser-cited works  (28, AlZaabi et al., 2023)  (30, Petiska, 2023). This trend could lead to a concentration of attention on a narrow set of ideas, potentially stifling the growth of more diverse or unconventional research directions.\n\nAnother critical issue is the potential homogenization of scientific ideas. The widespread use of one or a few LLMs could undercut epistemic diversity in science  (29, Alaniz et al., 2023). This concern is supported by recent findings that suggest the use of ChatGPT in creative tasks can result in increasingly homogenized content, with this effect persisting even when ChatGPT is not directly involved  (63, Zhou et al., 2024). Such homogenization poses a significant challenge to the argument that ChatGPT can enhance human creativity and may instead lead to a loss of scientific diversity.\n\nLLMs also introduce new challenges in maintaining academic integrity. The nature of training these models creates a risk of unintentional plagiarism or ghostwriting, as AI-generated text may closely resemble previously written work  (31, Alahdab, 2023). This situation could cast doubt on the originality of LLM-assisted academic work and potentially discourage truly novel contributions.\n\nFurthermore, while LLMs can work quickly, they struggle to replicate the nuanced \"human touch\" that is crucial in many aspects of scientific research and decision-making  (46, Abbasi, 2023). This limitation suggests that over-reliance on these tools could lead to a loss of important human insights and perspectives in scientific discourse.\n\nThe use of LLMs in literature reviews presents another potential issue. If researchers rely solely on these tools for overviewing literature, it could eliminate important citations, potentially leading to a crisis in academic publishing  (48, Balogh, 2023). This practice could further exacerbate the problem of citation bias and reduce the visibility of diverse scientific perspectives.\n\nWhile LLMs have significant potential to enhance scientific research, it is crucial to recognize and address these potential negative impacts on scientific diversity. Balancing the benefits of AI assistance with the preservation of human creativity, critical thinking, and diverse perspectives will be essential in ensuring that these tools contribute positively to the scientific landscape rather than narrowing it.\n\nReferences:\n1.

While these tools offer potential benefits for research and writing, they also present challenges that are prompting academic institutions and journals to reevaluate their policies and practices.\n\nThe emergence of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has sparked a profound transformation in academic publishing, bringing both opportunities and challenges to the forefront. One of the most pressing concerns is the potential for these AI tools to facilitate academic misconduct. There is widespread apprehension among scholars that ChatGPT could increase the likelihood of plagiarism and compromise research and writing ethics  (11, Qasem, 2023). This concern is exacerbated by the fear that predatory journals, which often lack rigorous quality checks, could be flooded with AI-generated articles on an unprecedented scale  (3, Privitera et al., 2023).\n\nThe impact of LLMs on the quality and originality of academic literature is a subject of intense debate. While AI-generated papers are typically not original research and may not contain new insights or findings  (9, Grimaldi et al., 2023), there is growing concern about the proliferation of \"scientific-looking papers devoid of scientific content\"  (15, Laufer et al., 2023). This influx of potentially low-quality or irrelevant submissions could overwhelm the academic review process  (18, Barros et al., 2023).\n\nIn response to these challenges, academic institutions and scientific journals are reevaluating their policies. Within two months of ChatGPT's release, many journals were forced to issue policies on \"non-human authors\" and the use of AI in article writing  (22, Verspoor et al., 2023). Editors are grappling with foundational questions about the role of generative AI in research and science  (24, Willcocks et al., 2023), and many journals are revising their editorial policies regarding AI use in submissions  (32, Tikhonova et al., 2023).\n\nDespite these concerns, some researchers see potential benefits in the use of LLMs for academic writing. An \"assisted-driving\" approach, where AI-generated text is supervised by humans, is being adopted by a growing number of researchers  (9, Grimaldi et al., 2023). ChatGPT has demonstrated the ability to draft \"high-quality\" papers for submission to academic journals, potentially influencing the scientific writing, reviewing, and editing processes for open-access journals  (39, Teng, 2023).\n\nHowever, the ease with which ChatGPT can produce research findings and substantial portions of text raises urgent questions about how to delineate and acknowledge AI-written content in academia  (54, Miller et al., 2023). There are also concerns about the reliability and provenance of AI-generated content, as ChatGPT has been found to generate confabulated references and lacks access to up-to-date research databases  (55, Palagani et al., 2023).\n\nAs the academic community continues to grapple with these issues, there is a growing consensus that while LLMs like ChatGPT offer exciting possibilities for scholarly writing, they also present significant potential for abuse  (41, Meir et al., 2023). The pressure on researchers to publish may lead some to view ChatGPT as a means to rapidly produce articles (56, Montague-Hellen, 2023), further complicating the landscape of academic publishing.\n\nIn conclusion, the impact of LLMs on academic publishing is multifaceted and evolving. While these tools offer potential benefits for research and writing, they also present significant challenges that are prompting a reevaluation of publishing practices and ethics in academia. As the field continues to adapt to this new technology, finding a balance between leveraging AI capabilities and maintaining the integrity and quality of scientific literature remains a critical challenge.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The scientific community must address ethical concerns and establish guidelines to ensure AI enhances rather than replaces human intellectual contributions.\n\nThe integration of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT into scientific research and academic writing presents both opportunities and challenges, necessitating a careful balance between AI assistance and human creativity. While these tools can accelerate various aspects of the research process, from literature reviews to manuscript drafting, it is essential to recognize the irreplaceable role of human intellect in scientific discovery  (4, Birhane et al., 2023).\n\nChatGPT and similar AI models can serve as valuable assistants in scientific endeavors, helping researchers refine arguments, suggest relevant literature, and even assist in data processing and hypothesis development  (64, Strielkowski, 2024)  (65, Menon et al., 2024). These capabilities can potentially enhance the diversity of scientific viewpoints and accelerate the innovation process  (27, Sarwar et al., 2023). However, it is crucial to view these AI tools as aids that complement human expertise rather than replace it.\n\nThe scientific community must critically evaluate the role of AI in research and address potential ethical dilemmas. There are concerns about the emergence of perverse incentives that could lead to a \"race to the bottom\" in research quality, with researchers potentially using AI to produce large volumes of barely publishable papers to boost their CVs  (40, Erler, 2023). To counter this, it is essential to uphold rigorous quality standards in research and establish clear guidelines for the use of AI in academic writing  (5, Verhagen et al., 2023).\n\nWhile ChatGPT itself claims to have the potential to increase public understanding of scientific concepts and address misinformation (20, Sch\u00e4fer, 2023), it is crucial to remember that AI models lack the nuanced understanding and interpretative capabilities that human scientists possess. The social and interpretative nature of scientific discovery cannot be fully replicated by AI, emphasizing the need for human oversight and critical thinking in research processes  (4, Birhane et al., 2023).\n\nAs the scientific community continues to adapt to the integration of AI tools, finding the right balance between leveraging AI capabilities and preserving human creativity remains a key challenge. Establishing ethical guidelines, maintaining transparency in AI use, and fostering a culture that values both technological innovation and human intellectual contributions will be crucial in ensuring that AI enhances rather than diminishes the quality and diversity of scientific research  (65, Menon et al., 2024).\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "6f526f72804ce3eb59feb7046f319ccc", "answer_text": "Importance of minimizing false positives\nTLDR: Minimizing false positives is crucial in AI-generated text detection to prevent harm and maintain scientific integrity. Effective detectors should have low false positive rates across diverse text types while maintaining high detection accuracy.\n\nIn scenarios where falsely identifying human-written text as AI-generated can have severe consequences, it is paramount to prioritize the minimization of false positives in detection systems  (8, Huang et al., 0). This is particularly critical in scientific contexts, where erroneously labeling human-authored abstracts as AI-generated could lead to significant scientific risks, potentially allowing genuine research to be mistakenly rejected from conferences or publications  (62, Asimakidou et al., 2023).\n\nTo address this challenge, detectors must achieve a delicate balance between high detection accuracy and low false positive rates across a wide range of document types. For instance, the Binoculars detector has demonstrated the ability to identify over 90% of ChatGPT and other LLM-generated samples while maintaining a false positive rate of just 0.01% across diverse text categories  (6, Cherepanova et al., 2024). This level of performance is crucial for truly reducing harm and ensuring the reliability of detection systems.\n\nCommon approaches for zero-shot text detection include statistical outlier detection based on entropy, perplexity, or n-gram frequencies, as well as thresholding average per-token log probabilities  (50, Huang et al., 2023). However, these methods must be carefully calibrated to minimize false positives while maintaining effective detection capabilities. Additionally, focusing on statistical data presentation in scientific contexts may aid in differentiating between human and AI-generated content, though further research is needed to identify specific elements that can reliably reveal AI-generated abstracts  (62, Asimakidou et al., 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(50, Huang et al., 2023) | n_citations: 15 | Towards Possibilities & Impossibilities of AI-generated Text Detection: A Survey ]: \nGiven a text passage, common approaches for zero-shot text detection include: (1) statistical outlier detection based on entropy... perplexity... or n-gram frequencies... and (2) calculating average per-token log probability of the given sequence and then thresholding... Hence, for such scenarios, it becomes crucial to minimize false positives while detecting AI-generated content.\n\n\n\nEffective detection tools and models\nTLDR: Various AI-generated text detection tools and models have been developed, ranging from zero-shot classifiers to fine-tuned language models. These tools demonstrate varying levels of accuracy and false positive rates, with some achieving over 90% detection rates while maintaining low false positives.\n\n- Binoculars: A detector that can identify over 90% of ChatGPT and other LLM-generated samples with a false positive rate of just 0.01% across diverse text types  (6, Cherepanova et al., 2024).\n\n- Fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa: Effective for detecting long, full-level texts but less reliable for shorter AI-generated content  (1, Wang et al., 2023). These models can be fine-tuned to detect text generated by themselves or similar models  (14, Jawahar et al., 2020).\n\n- GLTR (Giant Language model Test Room): A tool that applies statistical methods to detect machine-generated texts, helping human readers achieve over 72% accuracy in identifying fake text without prior training  (10, Rush et al., 2019)  (45, Zhang et al., 2023).\n\n- ChatGPT self-detection: ChatGPT itself has shown over 92% accuracy in detecting if essays were generated by itself, outperforming conventional plagiarism-detection tools  (36, Khalil et al., 2023).\n\n- Fast-DetectGPT: Achieves 87% recall for machine-generated texts with only 1% misclassification of human-written text  (40, Bao et al., 2023).\n\n- DetectGPT: A zero-shot classifier that compares log probabilities of perturbed texts using a pre-trained language model  (41, Li et al., 2023). It has shown over 95% accuracy in distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated text  (65, Jahrami et al., 2023).\n\n- ZeroGPT: Reported to achieve 98% accuracy and a precision score of 1.0 when its classifications were reduced to binary outcomes  (92, Mizouri et al., 2024).\n\n- GPTZero: Exhibits a low false-positive rate but a high false-negative rate  (93, Dascalu et al., 2024). However, it may classify manipulated articles containing significant human-written portions as human-written  (94, Qin et al., 2024).\n\n- UN C OVER: A tool that analyzes texts through stylometric writing style analysis, topic modeling, and entity recognition to predict and visualize AI-generated content  (70, Liebe et al., 2023).\n\n- Zero-shot classifiers: These employ pre-trained generative models like GPT-2 to identify texts generated by themselves or comparable models without additional supervised training  (54, Ibrahim, 2023)  (31, Wang et al., 2022).\n\nIt's important to note that while these tools show promise, their effectiveness can vary depending on the specific use case and the evolving nature of AI-generated text. Continuous evaluation and improvement of these detection methods are necessary to keep pace with advancements in text generation technologies.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Key practices include using ensemble methods, focusing on distinctive text features, and balancing detection accuracy with false positive minimization.\n\nTo accurately detect AI-generated texts while minimizing false positives, several best practices have emerged from recent research:\n\n1. Employ ensemble methods: Combining multiple detection techniques can improve overall accuracy. For instance, using a pipeline that incorporates both outlier detection and specialized text classification models can help filter out out-of-distribution examples before applying more targeted detection methods  (86, Mao et al., 2023).\n\n2. Focus on distinctive features: AI-generated text often exhibits certain characteristics that differ from human-written content. For example, research has shown that AI-generated scientific abstracts tend to be more generic than human-written ones  (61, Tsoukala et al., 2023). Detectors that leverage these distinctions can be more effective.\n\n3. Utilize \"fingerprinting\" techniques: Identifying unique sequences or patterns in AI-generated text can serve as fingerprints for detection. Implementing ranking mechanisms to remove false positives can further refine these approaches  (77, Zhou et al., 2023).\n\n4. Continuously adapt and improve detection methods: As AI text generation technologies evolve, detection methods must keep pace. Regular updates and retraining of detection models are crucial to maintain effectiveness  (53, AlQahtani et al., 2023).\n\n5. Incorporate human expertise: While automated detection is important, human judgment still plays a crucial role. However, it's worth noting that even experienced researchers may struggle to distinguish between AI-generated and human-written texts (85, Ostoji\u0107 et al., 2023)  (71, Matthews et al., 2023). This underscores the need for robust automated detection tools to support human decision-making.\n\n6. Balance accuracy and false positive rates: When developing detection models, it's critical to strike a balance between high detection accuracy and low false positive rates. For instance, some classifiers have shown promise in identifying AI-generated text but still mistakenly flag a significant portion of human-written text  (61, Tsoukala et al., 2023).\n\n7. Context-specific tuning: Detection methods should be tailored to the specific context in which they'll be used, as the characteristics of AI-generated text may vary across different domains (e.g., scientific writing vs. creative fiction) [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nBy implementing these best practices, organizations can enhance their ability to accurately detect AI-generated texts while minimizing the risk of false positives in high-stakes scenarios.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(61, Tsoukala et al., 2023) | n_citations: 3 | Detection of Fake Generated Scientific Abstracts ]: \nThe results suggest that there are significant differences in the distribution of text between humanwritten and AI-generated scientific work and that AI-generated abstracts tend to be more generic than human-written ones...

This differs from traditional machine learning approaches and showcases the adaptability of LLMs during inference.\n\nIn-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability exhibited by large language models (LLMs), particularly those based on transformer architectures  (3, Bhattamishra et al., 2023)  (11, Riedel et al., 2022). This ability allows LLMs to learn and perform tasks during inference by using a small number of demonstrations or examples provided in the input prompt, without requiring any updates to the model's parameters  (19, Driess et al., 2023)  (27, Zhou et al., 2023).\n\nThe key characteristics of in-context learning include:\n\n1. Few-shot learning: ICL enables LLMs to adapt to new tasks with just a handful of examples, showcasing impressive few-shot learning capabilities  (33, Jiang, 2023)  (40, Akata et al., 2023).\n\n2. No parameter updates: Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, ICL occurs during inference without any gradient updates or modifications to the model's weights  (19, Driess et al., 2023)  (93, Sourati et al., 2024).\n\n3. Task adaptation: LLMs can quickly adapt to novel tasks by conditioning on a prompt containing relevant task examples  (41, Singh et al., 2023)  (79, Cachola et al., 2023).\n\n4. Emergent behavior: ICL is considered an emergent property of LLMs, arising from their pretraining on vast amounts of data, though the exact mechanisms are not fully understood  (23, Wang et al., 2023).\n\n5. Model size dependence: The effectiveness of ICL tends to improve with larger model sizes and more extensive training data  (94, Tang et al., 2024).\n\n6. Contrast with traditional learning: ICL differs from traditional \"in-weights\" learning, where task-specific information is stored in the model weights during training  (38, Reddy, 2023).\n\nUnderstanding the theoretical foundations and empirical performance of in-context learning remains an active area of research, as scientists seek to demystify this powerful capability of LLMs  (3, Bhattamishra et al., 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(23, Wang et al., 2023) | n_citations: 45 | Large Language Models Are Latent Variable Models: Explaining and Finding Good Demonstrations for In-Context Learning ]: \nIn recent years, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in achieving an inference-time few-shot learning capability known as in-context learning...

[(94, Tang et al., 2024) | n_citations: 3 | Grimoire is All You Need for Enhancing Large Language Models ]: \nIn-context Learning (ICL) is one of the key methods for enhancing the performance of large language models on specific tasks by providing a set of few-shot examples...

[(38, Reddy, 2023) | n_citations: 18 | The mechanistic basis of data dependence and abrupt learning in an in-context classification task ]: \nTransformer models exhibit in-context learning: the ability to accurately predict the response to a novel query based on illustrative examples in the input sequence. In-context learning contrasts with traditional in-weights learning of query-output relationships.\n\n\n\nComparison with Traditional Machine Learning Training\nTLDR: In-context learning in LLMs differs significantly from traditional machine learning training. While traditional methods update model parameters through gradient descent, in-context learning adapts to tasks without parameter changes, relying on examples provided in the input prompt.\n\nIn-context learning (ICL) represents a paradigm shift in how machine learning models can adapt to new tasks, setting it apart from traditional machine learning training approaches in several key ways:\n\n1. No parameter updates: Unlike traditional machine learning methods that rely on gradient-based fine-tuning of model parameters, ICL requires no gradients or parameter updates  (4, Rainforth et al., 2023). This fundamental difference allows LLMs to adapt to new tasks during inference without modifying their underlying architecture.\n\n2. Information source: Traditional models store task-specific information in their weights during training. In contrast, LLMs can leverage two types of information: that stored in weights during pre-training and information provided \"in-context\" at inference time  (1, Hill et al., 2022). This dual approach to information processing enables greater flexibility in task adaptation.\n\n3. Generalization mechanisms: Research suggests that generalization from weights in traditional models tends to be more rule-based, while generalization from context in LLMs is largely exemplar-based  (1, Hill et al., 2022). This distinction highlights the unique way ICL approaches problem-solving.\n\n4. Task adaptation process: Traditional methods often require explicit task-specific training or fine-tuning. In contrast, ICL allows LLMs to implicitly learn from examples in the prompt, adapting to new tasks without specific training  (26, Zhang et al., 2023)  (29, Noori et al., 2023).\n\n5. Learning during inference: ICL enables LLMs to learn new tasks via inference only, conditioning on demonstration examples without any gradient updates  (34, Gao et al., 2023). This capability is particularly valuable for large models where direct fine-tuning may be impractical.\n\n6. Emergent ability: ICL is considered an emergent ability of LLMs, distinguishing them from previous pre-trained language models. Given a natural language instruction and task demonstrations, LLMs can generate outputs by completing word sequences without additional training or tuning  (36, Jiang et al., 2023).\n\n7. Implicit learning: Compared to regular supervised learning, LLMs can learn implicitly by prompting with a few training examples as demonstrations  (50, Zhao et al., 2023). This allows for rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal examples.\n\n8. Alternative to fine-tuning: ICL offers an alternative way to instruct LLMs to learn new tasks, especially useful when direct fine-tuning is not feasible due to model size or computational constraints  (34, Gao et al., 2023).\n\nIn summary, in-context learning represents a fundamentally different approach to task adaptation compared to traditional machine learning training. It leverages the pre-trained knowledge of LLMs to perform new tasks based on examples provided in the input, without the need for explicit parameter updates or task-specific training.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(50, Zhao et al., 2023) | n_citations: 8 | Generative Calibration for In-context Learning ]: \nCompared to regular supervised learning, LLMs can learn implicitly by prompting a few training examples as demonstrations, i.e., in context.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of In-Context Learning\nTLDR: In-context learning offers several key advantages, including efficient task adaptation without model fine-tuning, improved performance with few examples, and the ability to customize large language models for specific tasks.\n\n1. Efficient task adaptation: In-context learning allows large language models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks during inference without the need for parameter updates or fine-tuning  (2, Dziri et al., 2023). This enables rapid deployment of LLMs for various applications with minimal computational overhead.\n\n2. Few-shot learning capabilities: LLMs can achieve impressive performance on new tasks with just a handful of examples provided in the prompt. This few-shot learning ability allows for quick adaptation to diverse scenarios  (30, Dai et al., 2023).\n\n3. Customization for specific tasks: In-context learning enables users to customize LLMs for their specific needs by providing relevant examples, making it easier to tailor model outputs to particular domains or requirements  (45, Heer et al., 2023).\n\n4. Improved performance with demonstration examples: Fine-tuning language models with demonstration examples in the instructions has been shown to enhance their ability to learn from examples in context, leading to better overall performance  (12, Wang et al., 2022).\n\n5. State-of-the-art performance without training: Recent advancements in in-context few-shot and zero-shot prompting techniques have enabled LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks without the need for additional training  (96, Liu et al., 2024).\n\n6. Flexibility in example quantity: While zero-shot and one-shot learning can be effective, providing more examples (e.g., ten or more) can significantly improve performance, allowing users to fine-tune the trade-off between prompt length and model performance  (28, Wang et al., 2023).\n\n7. Alignment without fine-tuning: In-context learning enables LLMs to produce aligned responses by ingesting well-aligned samples from external sources, mimicking them without the need for model fine-tuning  (97, Fan et al., 2024).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These limitations highlight the need for careful example selection and prompt engineering when utilizing in-context learning with LLMs.\n\n1. Context sensitivity: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes ignore provided context and rely on their pre-trained knowledge, potentially leading to inconsistent or inaccurate responses  (14, Lukasik et al., 2022).\n\n2. Performance variability: The effectiveness of in-context learning can be highly sensitive to the selection and order of demonstration examples, resulting in significant fluctuations in model performance  (95, Liu et al., 2024)  (99, Yan et al., 2024).\n\n3. Zero-shot limitations: While zero-shot capabilities are valuable, LLMs often exhibit weaker performance and larger fluctuations in zero-shot settings compared to few-shot scenarios  (53, Dai et al., 2023).\n\n4. Example dependence: The success of in-context learning heavily relies on the choice of demonstrations, which can be challenging to optimize for different tasks and domains  (100, Van et al., 2024).\n\n5. Diminishing returns: As more detailed instructions are added to input prompts, the benefits of optimizing in-context examples may decrease, suggesting a potential trade-off between prompt complexity and performance gains  (101, Sharma et al., 2024).\n\n6. Model architecture differences: Causal language models (CausalLMs) appear to be more sensitive to the order of in-context demonstration examples compared to prefix language models (PrefixLMs), indicating that the effectiveness of in-context learning may vary across different model architectures  (99, Yan et al., 2024).\n\n7. Lack of full understanding: Despite the advancements in in-context learning strategies, the underlying mechanisms of why certain demonstrations work better than others and what factors influence their selection are not yet fully understood  (95, Liu et al., 2024).\n\n8. Prompt engineering challenges: The limitations in context sensitivity and performance variability necessitate careful prompt engineering and example selection to maximize the effectiveness of in-context learning [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1. [(14, Lukasik et al., 2022) | n_citations: 91 | Large Language Models with Controllable Working Memory ]: \nHowever, we demonstrate in this paper that this approach may fall short for many existing LLMs as they have greater tendencies to ignore the context and stick to their own pretrained world knowledge.\n\n2. [(95, Liu et al., 2024) | n_citations: 3 | Revisiting Demonstration Selection Strategies in In-Context Learning ]: \nWhile in-context learning... has shown its impressive fewshot performance, recent work has found that LLMs are very sensitive to the selected examples leading to large variances in performance...

[(53, Dai et al., 2023) | n_citations: 5 | Universal Self-adaptive Prompting ]: \nWhile the zero-shot performances of LLMs are highly valued and widely used as a key yardstick of LLM capabilities... LLMs still often show weaker performances and/or larger performance fluctuations in the zero-shot setting because of the lack of guidance or readily-available template solutions.\n\n5. [(100, Van et al., 2024) | n_citations: 1 | In-Context Learning Demonstration Selection via Influence Analysis ]: \nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling few-shot learning without the need for gradient updates... the effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the choice of demonstrations.\n\n6. [(101, Sharma et al., 2024) | n_citations: 1 | NICE: To Optimize In-Context Examples or Not? ]: \nUsing state-of-the-art LLMs, our main finding is that returns on ICE optimization diminish as more detailed instructions are added to the input prompt.\n\n\n\nMechanisms and Theories Behind In-Context Learning\nTLDR: In-context learning in LLMs is theorized to approximate higher-order optimization methods, potentially sharing similarities with fine-tuning. Recent research suggests that the effectiveness of ICL is linked to specific properties of training data and the model's internal optimization processes.\n\nThe mechanisms and theories behind in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) are an active area of research, with several intriguing hypotheses emerging:\n\n1. Data distribution properties: ICL appears to emerge when training data exhibits specific characteristics such as burstiness (items appearing in clusters) and the presence of numerous rare classes. These properties, common in natural language and other naturalistic data, differ significantly from the uniform, i.i.d. distributions typically used in standard supervised learning  (13, Chan et al., 2022).\n\n2. Similarity to fine-tuning: One plausible theory suggests that ICL in LLMs might share similarities with fine-tuning, allowing models to 'learn' from examples presented in their prompt  (21, Madabushi et al., 2023). This perspective helps explain the model's ability to adapt to new tasks without explicit parameter updates.\n\n3. Higher-order optimization: Recent research indicates that Transformers, the architecture underlying many LLMs, may learn to approximate higher-order optimization methods for ICL. Studies have shown that Transformers share a similar convergence rate with Iterative Newton's Method, both being exponentially faster than traditional Gradient Descent  (39, Chen et al., 2023). This suggests that LLMs may be performing a more sophisticated form of internal optimization during ICL.\n\n4. Skill learning vs. skill recognition: Researchers have proposed a distinction between \"skill learning\" and \"skill recognition\" in ICL. Skill learning involves the ability to learn new data generation functions from in-context data, while skill recognition refers to the model's capacity to identify and apply previously learned skills  (89, Mao et al., 2024). This differentiation helps in understanding the various ways LLMs leverage in-context information.\n\n5. Meta-optimization process: Some researchers approach ICL as a meta-optimization process. For instance, the Batch-ICL method employs multiple separate 1-shot forward computations and aggregates the resulting meta-gradients, which are then applied to a zero-shot query for final prediction  (92, Chen et al., 2024). This perspective offers insights into how LLMs might internally process and utilize in-context examples.\n\nThese theories and mechanisms provide a framework for understanding how LLMs perform in-context learning, highlighting the complex interplay between model architecture, training data properties, and internal optimization processes. As research in this area continues to evolve, our understanding of ICL is likely to deepen, potentially leading to more effective and efficient ways of leveraging this capability in LLMs.\n\nReferences:\n1.

It can be categorized into two main types: train set overfitting and test set overfitting.\n\nOverfitting is a fundamental concept in machine learning that refers to a model's tendency to perform exceptionally well on the data it was trained on, but fail to generalize to new, unseen data. The primary symptom of overfitting is a noticeable divergence between a model's in-sample (training data) performance and its out-of-sample (new data) performance, which is known as the generalization error  (8, Rebonato et al., 2020).\n\nRebonato et al. distinguish between two types of overfitting: overfitting that occurs on the train set and overfitting that occurs on the test set  (8, Rebonato et al., 2020). Train set overfitting happens when a model learns the noise and peculiarities of the training data too well, effectively memorizing the data rather than learning generalizable patterns. Test set overfitting, on the other hand, occurs when the model is tuned too closely to the specific characteristics of the test set, potentially through repeated evaluations and adjustments based on test set performance.\n\nUnderstanding these distinct types of overfitting is crucial for developing robust machine learning models and implementing effective strategies to mitigate overfitting in various learning contexts [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1. [(8, Rebonato et al., 2020) | n_citations: 51 | Machine Learning for Asset Managers (Chapter 1) ]: \nThe primary symptom of overfitting is a divergence between a model's in-sample and out-of-sample performance (known as the generalization error).We can distinguish between two types of overfitting: the overfitting that occurs on the train set, and the overfitting that occurs on the test set.\n\n\n\nCauses and Symptoms of Overfitting\nTLDR: Overfitting in machine learning models can be caused by overparameterization and the use of unbounded loss functions. Symptoms include negative empirical training risks and a significant gap between training and test performance.\n\nOverfitting remains a central challenge in machine learning, with its causes and symptoms being areas of active research. One notable cause of overfitting is overparameterization, where models have a high number of parameters relative to the amount of training data. Contrary to classical statistical learning theory, which suggests that overparameterized models should have high excess risks due to overfitting, recent empirical successes of such models have challenged this conventional wisdom  (21, Meng et al., 2022). This paradox highlights the complexity of understanding and predicting overfitting in modern machine learning architectures.\n\nAnother potential cause of overfitting has been identified in the use of unbounded loss functions, such as cross-entropy loss. Sugiyama et al. observed that empirical training risks can become negative during training, leading to a conjecture that overfitting may be attributed to negative terms in the rewritten risk function  (25, Sugiyama et al., 2022). In extreme cases, this phenomenon can cause the empirical training risk to diverge to negative infinity, exacerbating the overfitting problem.\n\nThe symptoms of overfitting are often manifested in the model's performance metrics. A key indicator is a significant discrepancy between the model's performance on the training data versus its performance on unseen test data [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. This gap suggests that the model has learned to fit the noise in the training data rather than capturing generalizable patterns. Additionally, the observation of negative empirical training risks during the training process can serve as an early warning sign of potential overfitting  (25, Sugiyama et al., 2022).\n\nUnderstanding these causes and recognizing the symptoms of overfitting is crucial for developing more robust machine learning models and implementing effective strategies to mitigate its effects, particularly in the context of in-context learning and other advanced machine learning paradigms.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(21, Meng et al., 2022) | n_citations: 4 | Multiple Descent in the Multiple Random Feature Model ]: \nHowever, in classical statistical learning theory, overparameterized models are believed to have high excess risks due to overfitting, and hence their success has not been fully explained in theory.\n\n2. [(25, Sugiyama et al., 2022) | n_citations: 0 | Learning from Multiple Unlabeled Datasets with Partial Risk Regularization ]: \nBased on another observation that the empirical training risks can go negative during training, we conjecture that the overfitting is due to the negative terms included in the rewritten risk function: when unbounded loss functions, e.g., the cross-entropy loss, are used, the empirical training risk can even diverge to negative infinity.\n\n\n\nOverfitting in Meta-Learning and In-Context Learning\nTLDR: Meta-learning and in-context learning introduce additional layers of complexity that can lead to new forms of overfitting. These include meta-overfitting in meta-learning and overfitting during fine-tuning in in-context learning scenarios.\n\nMeta-learning and in-context learning represent advanced paradigms in machine learning that aim to improve model adaptability and performance across various tasks. However, these approaches introduce new challenges in terms of overfitting. In meta-learning, the risk of overfitting extends beyond the traditional model-level concerns to include the meta-level as well. Jang et al. explain that meta-learning algorithms learn two components: a predictive model for a task and a base learner that quickly updates the model for new tasks. While this dual learning process can be powerful, it also creates an additional potential source of overfitting, as overfit can occur in either the model or the base learner  (6, Jang et al., 2020).\n\nThe concept of \"meta-overfitting\" has been identified as a specific challenge in meta-learning scenarios. Miranda suggests that meta-overfitting occurs when the number of classes or concepts in the meta-learning task is finite. Interestingly, this issue may diminish when the task involves an unbounded number of concepts. A key indicator of meta-overfitting is a high degree of meta-learning coupled with a significant generalization gap between meta-train and meta-test errors  (11, Miranda, 2020).\n\nIn the context of in-context learning, which often involves fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific tasks, overfitting remains a concern. Li et al. note that while in-context learning can improve upon traditional supervised learning in various cases, overfitting has been observed during the fine-tuning process  (20, Li et al., 2022). This suggests that even with the benefits of transfer learning and adaptability offered by in-context approaches, careful consideration must be given to prevent overfitting during the adaptation phase.\n\nUnderstanding and mitigating these new forms of overfitting in meta-learning and in-context learning scenarios is crucial for developing robust and generalizable models in these advanced learning paradigms. Researchers and practitioners must be aware of these additional layers of complexity when designing and implementing such systems to ensure optimal performance across diverse tasks and domains.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(6, Jang et al., 2020) | n_citations: 79 | Meta-Learning Requires Meta-Augmentation ]: \nMeta-learning algorithms aim to learn two components: a model that predicts targets for a task, and a base learner that quickly updates that model when given examples from a new task... This additional level of learning can be powerful, but it also creates another potential source for overfitting, since we can now overfit in either the model or the base learner.\n\n2. [(11, Miranda, 2020) | n_citations: 1 | An Empirical Study of Meta-Learning: a step towards rigorously understanding meta-learning algorithms ]: \nmeta-over\ufb01tting occurs when the number of classes (or concepts) are \ufb01nite and this issue disappears once the task has an unbounded number of concepts... a high degree of meta-learning coupled with a high generalization gap between meta-train and meta-test errors would suggest meta-overfitting.\n\n3. [(20, Li et al., 2022) | n_citations: 21 | Robust Fine-Tuning of Deep Neural Networks with Hessian-based Generalization Guarantees ]: \nWhile this approach improves upon supervised learning in various cases, overfitting has also been observed during fine-tuning.\n\n\n\nMeasuring and Estimating Overfitting\nTLDR: Measuring overfitting typically involves comparing a model's performance on training and test data. Various metrics and techniques have been developed to quantify and estimate the degree of overfitting in machine learning models.\n\nMeasuring and estimating overfitting is crucial for assessing the generalization capability of machine learning models. The primary approach to quantifying overfitting is by examining the difference between a model's performance on training data versus its performance on unseen test data. This difference is commonly referred to as the generalization error  (8, Rebonato et al., 2020). \n\nOne straightforward method for estimating the degree of overfitting is to calculate the difference between the empirical risk (a measure of model performance) on the training set and the test set. Allingham et al. propose this approach, suggesting that the magnitude of this difference provides a quantitative measure of how much a model has overfit to the training data  (16, Allingham et al., 2021).\n\nIt's important to note that overfitting can occur not only on the training set but also on the test set. Rebonato et al. highlight this distinction, emphasizing the need to consider both types of overfitting when evaluating model performance  (8, Rebonato et al., 2020). This insight suggests that relying solely on the traditional train-test split may not be sufficient for accurately measuring overfitting in all scenarios.\n\nTo address these challenges, more sophisticated techniques for measuring and estimating overfitting have been developed. These may include cross-validation methods, regularization techniques, and analysis of learning curves [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. These approaches aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of a model's generalization capabilities and help researchers and practitioners identify and mitigate overfitting more effectively.\n\nIn the context of in-context learning and meta-learning, measuring overfitting becomes even more complex due to the additional layers of adaptation and learning involved. Future research in this area may need to develop specialized metrics and estimation techniques that account for the unique characteristics of these advanced learning paradigms [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(16, Allingham et al., 2021) | n_citations: 2 | Depth Uncertainty Networks for Active Learning ]: \nWe estimate the degree of overfitting as the difference between these two values of the empirical risk.\n\n\n\n"}

Several studies have explored the effectiveness of LLMs in this domain, with a particular focus on classification tasks  (1, Buendia et al., 2022)  (2, Chen, 2022)  (6, Shugani et al., 2023).

Zhang et al. reported that while fine-tuned LLMs showed competitive performance in very few-shot scenarios, they slightly underperformed compared to classical tree models and tabular networks when more training data was available  (3, Zhang et al., 2023). This suggests that the advantages of LLMs may be more pronounced in data-scarce situations.\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of LLMs for tabular data tasks is not universal. Aphinyanaphongs et al. pointed out that many works exploring LLMs for traditional supervised and unsupervised learning tasks often rely on fine-tuning, indicating that current LLMs may have limited ability to solve complex tasks with raw tabular data using only in-context learning  (40, Aphinyanaphongs et al., 2023). Additionally, Wu et al. found that traditional methods were superior to in-context learning of LLMs, even when considering only the cases where LLMs gave confident answers  (45, Wu et al., 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, while LLMs have shown promise in competing with traditional ML methods for tabular data tasks, especially in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, their performance can vary depending on the specific task, dataset, and amount of available training data.

Careful consideration of these factors can significantly impact the effectiveness of LLMs in handling tabular information.\n\n- Instructions: The use of task-specific instructions can consistently benefit LLM performance on tabular prediction tasks. However, LLMs may sometimes ignore instructions or fail to predict specific instances correctly, even when provided with examples  (4, Singh et al., 2023).\n\n- In-Context Learning (ICL) Examples: The choice of training examples for ICL significantly impacts performance. Randomly sampling examples from a training set can lead to high variance in results, emphasizing the importance of careful example selection  (15, Chang et al., 2022).\n\n- Model Size and Training Data: Larger model parameter sizes and more extensive learning data generally correlate with stronger ICL capabilities. This suggests that the performance of LLMs on tabular tasks may improve as models become larger and are trained on more diverse datasets  (55, Tang et al., 2024).\n\n- Task Complexity: While LLMs have shown remarkable generalization on various NLP tasks, their performance on complex tabular tasks using only in-context learning may be limited. Some studies indicate that fine-tuning is often necessary for more challenging tabular data tasks  (53, Bhatia et al., 2024).\n\n- Model Type: \"Vanilla\" or untuned LLMs may lag behind tuned state-of-the-art models on many common NLP benchmarks, including tasks involving tabular data. This suggests that model specialization or fine-tuning may be beneficial for optimal performance  (25, Hupkes et al., 2023).\n\n- Table Reasoning Capabilities: Recent research has demonstrated that LLMs can reason about tables using in-context learning, opening up new possibilities for tabular data tasks. However, the effectiveness may vary depending on the specific model and task  (56, Dou et al., 2024).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These challenges highlight areas for improvement in LLM applications to tabular data.\n\n- Instruction Adherence: LLMs often struggle to consistently follow instructions in tabular prediction tasks. They may ignore provided instructions or fail to correctly predict specific instances, even when given examples  (4, Singh et al., 2023).\n\n- Data Format Mismatch: LLMs are primarily trained on text data, which differs significantly from tabular data structures. This fundamental mismatch can limit their effectiveness when dealing with raw tabular data  (11, Dong et al., 0).\n\n- Performance Gap: Untuned or \"vanilla\" LLMs tend to underperform compared to fine-tuned models on common NLP benchmarks, including tasks involving tabular data. This suggests that specialized training or fine-tuning may be necessary for optimal performance  (25, Hupkes et al., 2023).\n\n- Limited In-Context Learning for Complex Tasks: While LLMs show promise in various data management tasks using in-context learning (ICL), their ability to solve complex tasks with raw tabular data using only ICL appears limited. Many applications still rely on fine-tuning for more challenging tabular data tasks  (40, Aphinyanaphongs et al., 2023)  (44, Fan et al., 2023).\n\n- Inherited Biases: LLMs can inherit social biases from their training data, which may significantly impact their fairness in tabular classification tasks.

{"case_id": "456d3c2c757f4b874abddb18a62f2ff8", "answer_text": "Contribution Patterns and Metrics\nTLDR: GitHub commits and pull requests reveal diverse contribution patterns among developers, from casual contributors to core team members. Metrics derived from these activities offer insights into developer productivity, expertise, and project dynamics.\n\nDeveloper contributions on GitHub exhibit a wide range of patterns, reflecting the diverse ways individuals engage with open-source projects. One significant finding is the prevalence of casual contributors, who make up a substantial portion of the developer base but account for a smaller share of accepted contributions. Research shows that an average of 66% of contributors can be classified as casual, responsible for 12.5% of accepted contributions  (2, Pinto et al., 2020). This pattern highlights the importance of understanding different levels of engagement in open-source communities.\n\nThe frequency and volume of commits serve as key indicators of developer involvement and expertise. Core developers typically make frequent contributions to the codebase, resulting in higher commit counts compared to peripheral developers  (37, Joblin et al., 2016). However, it's important to note that raw commit counts may not always accurately reflect productivity or impact. Studies have shown that the top 10% of developers are involved in 84.2% of commits, either as authors or reviewers  (148, Imtiaz et al., 2023), indicating a concentration of activity among a smaller group of highly active contributors.\n\nLinking practices between different GitHub features provide insights into developer behavior and project management. Developers frequently establish connections between issues, pull requests, and commits, with 84.26% of cases showing links between commits and both problems and solutions  (3, Verma, 2020). This linking behavior demonstrates how developers use GitHub's features to maintain traceability and context in their work.\n\nSeveral metrics have been developed to gauge developer contributions and expertise. These include measures based on commit history, which can be used to identify developers likely to be experts in specific source code files  (10, Poshyvanyk et al., 2012). Other notable metrics include code churn and the number of commits generated by each developer, which have been found to be good indicators of defect-prone source code files in some projects  (35, Thongtanunam et al., 2016).\n\nIt's important to recognize that contribution patterns can vary significantly across projects and over time. The distribution of contributions often follows a long-tail pattern, with many developers making very few commits to each repository  (57, Consens et al., 2018). Additionally, research has shown that raw developer output, as measured by the number of changes, may plateau over a project-specific period  (151, Abreu et al., 2023). This suggests that more nuanced metrics may be necessary to accurately assess developer productivity and impact, especially as developers gain experience and work on more central parts of a system.\n\nIn conclusion, analyzing GitHub commits and pull requests provides valuable insights into developer behavior, project dynamics, and contribution patterns. These metrics can inform project management, identify key contributors, and help understand the diverse ways in which developers engage with open-source projects.\n\nReferences:\n1.

We start by partially replicating prior work and show that the raw number of developer commits plateaus over a project-specific period.\n\n\n\nSocial Aspects and Networking\nTLDR: GitHub's social features significantly influence developer behavior, from contribution choices to pull request evaluations. Social connections and reputation play a crucial role in open-source collaboration, often intertwining with technical merit in decision-making processes.\n\nGitHub's platform goes beyond mere code hosting, incorporating social networking features that profoundly impact developer interactions and project dynamics. Research has shown that developers make rich social inferences from networked activity information on GitHub, using these insights to coordinate work, improve technical skills, and manage their reputation  (9, Tsay et al., 2012). This social layer adds complexity to the often-idealized meritocratic view of open-source software development.\n\nThe presence of highly connected developers, sometimes referred to as \"rockstars,\" has been observed to have a disproportionate influence on project contributions. These influential developers' actions have a greater impact on their followers compared to regular developers, with different types of actions affecting followers in varied ways  (1, Ferwerda et al., 2013). This phenomenon highlights the importance of social status and networking within the GitHub ecosystem.\n\nSocial connections play a significant role in project participation and contribution evaluation. As developers join new projects, they are exposed to other contributors, and the strength of their social connections to a project is determined by their aggregate connections to existing project members  (26, Vasilescu et al., 2015). These social ties can influence a developer's likelihood of joining a project team, with factors such as the number of commits to personal projects and personal followers having a positive impact on team inclusion  (54, Meade et al., 2018).\n\nThe evaluation of pull requests, a critical aspect of open-source collaboration, is not solely based on technical merit. Project managers consider both the technical quality of contributions and the strength of social connections between the submitter and themselves when assessing pull requests  (18, Tsay et al., 2014). This finding challenges the pure meritocracy narrative and underscores the complex social structures underlying open-source projects.\n\nDevelopers' past actions, overall activity, and status on GitHub (e.g., previous pull requests, role in the project, level of activity, number of followers) influence how they are perceived by others in terms of competence and trustworthiness  (139, Sajadi et al., 2023). This perception can affect the likelihood of their contributions being accepted and their ability to influence project direction.\n\nThe social aspects of GitHub, combined with the pull request mechanism, have lowered barriers to entry for newcomers, enabling developers to participate in multiple projects simultaneously  (26, Vasilescu et al., 2015). This has led to a more dynamic and interconnected development ecosystem, where developers can more easily contribute to various projects and build their reputation across the platform.\n\nIn conclusion, the social features of GitHub play a crucial role in shaping developer behavior, project dynamics, and contribution patterns. Understanding these social aspects is essential for both project maintainers and contributors, as they significantly influence collaboration, decision-making, and the overall success of open-source projects on the platform.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(9, Tsay et al., 2012) | n_citations: 979 | Social coding in GitHub: transparency and collaboration in an open software repository ]: \nDevelopers make a surprisingly rich set of social inferences from the networked activity information in GitHub... Users combine these inferences into effective strategies for coordinating work, advancing technical skills and managing their reputation...

Prior Social Connections: As developers join new projects, they are exposed to other project contributors...

[(18, Tsay et al., 2014) | n_citations: 371 | Influence of social and technical factors for evaluating contribution in GitHub ]: \nOpen source software is commonly portrayed as a meritocracy, where decisions are based solely on their technical merit. However, literature on open source suggests a complex social structure underlying the meritocracy... We found that project managers made use of information signaling both good technical contribution practices for a pull request and the strength of the social connection between the submitter and project manager when evaluating pull requests.\n\n6. [(139, Sajadi et al., 2023) | n_citations: 7 | Interpersonal Trust in OSS: Exploring Dimensions of Trust in GitHub Pull Requests ]: \nDevelopers' past actions in the repository, their overall activity, and their status on GitHub (e.g., previous pull requests, role in the project, level of activity, number of followers, etc.) influence the trustor's perception of the trustee's competence... 75 out of 100 pull requests involved additional commits that were made as a result of developers' interactions.\n\n\n\nPull Request Characteristics and Outcomes\nTLDR: Pull requests on GitHub exhibit diverse characteristics that influence their outcomes, including acceptance rates and processing times. Factors such as code quality, contributor experience, and social dynamics play significant roles in the evaluation and integration of pull requests.\n\nThe pull request model has emerged as a fundamental mechanism for facilitating open-source collaboration on platforms like GitHub. This model offers several advantages, including fast turnaround times and increased opportunities for community engagement  (16, Gousios et al., 2014). However, the success of pull requests depends on various factors that project maintainers and contributors should be aware of.\n\nOne key aspect influencing pull request outcomes is the characteristics of the contributors themselves. Research has shown that the number of developers involved in a project and their working experience with the project can significantly impact the success and failure rates of pull requests  (20, Roy et al., 2014). Additionally, the profile of external contributors and their social relationships within the project community have been found to influence the lifetime of pull requests  (83, Soares et al., 2020).\n\nThe content and nature of pull requests also play a crucial role in their evaluation. Duplicate pull requests, which result in redundant use of resources, often exhibit different features compared to non-duplicate ones. They are more likely to be submitted by inexperienced contributors, focus on bug fixes, touch cold files, and address tracked issues  (121, Yin et al., 2022). Furthermore, pull requests that undergo modifications during the review process tend to have longer lifetimes but higher acceptance rates, with different types of modifications impacting the process differently  (129, Zheng et al., 2022).\n\nThe quality of the code introduced in pull requests has been a subject of debate regarding its impact on acceptance probability. While some studies suggest that source code quality plays a marginal role in pull request acceptance across different programming languages  (150, Rossi et al., 2023), others have found that factors such as code churn, number of file changes, and review comments can significantly differentiate between refactoring-inducing and non-refactoring-inducing pull requests  (105, Coelho et al., 2021).\n\nThe review process itself is an essential component of pull request evaluation. Approximately 12% of pull requests undergo explicit code reviewing, receiving comments on specific lines of code in the included commits  (16, Gousios et al., 2014). The sentiment and emotions expressed in pull request discussions can also influence their acceptance, highlighting the importance of social and psychological factors in the evaluation process  (92, Ortu et al., 2020).\n\nInterestingly, the use of reactions on pull requests provides insights into the evaluation dynamics. Contributors tend to react to the source code, while outsiders focus more on the impact on end-user experience. The majority of reactions (a median of 78.40%) occur before the pull request is closed, with only a small percentage (median 1.95%) being negative  (140, Yung et al., 2023).\n\nTechnical aspects of pull request management, such as rebasing, are also prevalent. Rebasing is widely used to resolve textual conflicts, with developers adopting similar strategies to those used in explicit merges. Notably, in 34.2% of non-conflict rebase scenarios, developers add new changes during the rebase process  (84, Yi et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the characteristics and outcomes of pull requests on GitHub are influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including contributor experience, code quality, social dynamics, and technical practices. Understanding these factors can help both contributors and maintainers navigate the pull request process more effectively, potentially leading to improved collaboration and project outcomes.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Metrics derived from commits, pull requests, and social interactions offer a multifaceted view of developer expertise and engagement, though they have limitations in fully capturing the complexity of software development work.\n\nDeveloper productivity and activity on GitHub can be assessed through various metrics and patterns observed in their interactions with the platform. Commits and pull requests serve as primary indicators of a developer's involvement in a project, with core developers often identified by their write access to repositories or their ability to close issues and pull requests submitted by others  (25, Wang et al., 2015). These metrics can provide insights into a developer's workload and activeness within a project community  (102, Murphy et al., 2021).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that developer activity on GitHub extends beyond code contributions. With the platform's social features, developers engage in various ways, including expressing interest in projects, leaving comments, or submitting occasional pull requests  (123, Zhao et al., 2022). This broader spectrum of activities challenges the notion that commits alone can fully represent a developer's engagement or expertise.\n\nThe analysis of GitHub data has been used to identify developer skills and expertise, which is of particular interest to recruiters  (126, Scordialo et al., 2022). Studies have shown that a developer's commit and pull-request records can be indicative of their code efficiency and capability, although the quality of these contributions is not always taken into account  (99, Chen et al., 2020). It's worth noting that some developers contribute to multiple projects simultaneously, with some prolific individuals contributing to 5-10 GitHub projects in a single week  (93, Kohl et al., 2020).\n\nThe visibility of developer behaviors on GitHub, even after they leave a project, provides a persistent record of their contributions and interactions  (4, Li et al., 2022). This transparency can influence project maintenance efforts and potentially impact a developer's reputation within the open-source community.\n\nTo gain a more comprehensive understanding of developer activities, some researchers have investigated self-reported tasks, particularly in specific domains like Android app development. These studies aim to create taxonomies of developer activities and explore the feasibility of automated classification approaches  (52, Bacchelli et al., 2018). Such efforts complement the data-driven metrics obtained from GitHub, providing a more nuanced view of developer productivity and work patterns.\n\nIn conclusion, while GitHub data offers valuable insights into developer productivity and activity, it's crucial to consider a wide range of metrics and interactions beyond just commit counts. The complex nature of software development work and the diverse ways developers engage with projects on GitHub necessitate a multifaceted approach to understanding developer behavior and expertise.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Changes in gamification elements and user interface design can lead to measurable shifts in activity levels and collaboration dynamics.\n\nThe design and implementation of platform features on GitHub have a profound impact on developer behavior and engagement patterns. One striking example of this influence comes from a study on the removal of daily activity streak counters from user profile pages  (82, Strohmaier et al., 2020). This unannounced change led to significant alterations in developer behavior, including the abandonment of long-running streaks and a decrease in weekend activity. Additionally, the frequency of days with single contributions diminished, suggesting that the gamification element of streak counters had been a powerful motivator for consistent activity.\n\nThe impact of GitHub features extends beyond individual activity metrics to broader software engineering practices and social dynamics. Researchers have extensively explored various platform elements such as pull requests, issues, forks, commit comments, README files, stars, and badges to understand their influence on developer behavior  (87, Parnin et al., 2020). These features not only shape how developers interact with projects but also affect collaboration patterns and project management practices.\n\nThe social aspect of GitHub's gamification features is particularly noteworthy. The removal of streak counters not only affected individual behavior but also led to a decrease in the synchronization of streaking behavior within the platform's social network  (90, Moldon et al., 2020). This finding underscores the powerful role of gamification as a channel for social influence among developers on the platform.\n\nThese studies collectively demonstrate that seemingly minor changes to platform features can have far-reaching consequences on developer behavior. Project maintainers and platform designers should carefully consider the potential impacts of interface modifications and gamification elements on user engagement, contribution patterns, and overall project dynamics. Understanding these influences can help in designing more effective collaboration tools and fostering healthier, more productive open-source communities on GitHub.\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "36d9a01cd11997e14deb22537f52f266", "answer_text": "Vulnerability Detection and Assessment\nTLDR: Effective vulnerability detection in third-party libraries involves using various scanning techniques and focusing on actually exploitable vulnerabilities. Regular assessments and targeted remediation are crucial for maintaining software security.\n\nDetecting and assessing vulnerabilities in third-party libraries is a critical first step in protecting software against potential security threats. One primary method is using vulnerability scanners, which examine software for known vulnerabilities listed in databases through external scripts  (54, Langstrof et al., 2024). This approach can be enhanced by focusing on vulnerabilities where the vulnerable code inside libraries is actually used within the project, as implemented by tools like Steady, which helps reduce false positives  (47, Cruz et al., 2023).\n\nIt's important to note that not all vulnerabilities in library versions are equally critical. If vulnerable functions are not called by the software, they should be considered false positives, allowing efforts to focus on mitigating actually exploitable vulnerabilities  (35, Hell et al., 2021). This targeted approach is crucial because vulnerabilities in libraries can be more critical than bugs in other software due to their potential to affect various programs that use the libraries  (22, Jang et al., 2019).\n\nCurrent DevSecOps practices often include code scanning to discover package dependencies and determine if they contain known vulnerabilities  (36, Luan et al., 2021). Some tools can also detect the use of library versions with security issues and identify security threats related to the source code  (37, URIARTE et al., 2021). For more proactive vulnerability prevention, greybox fuzzing can be used to test libraries  (22, Jang et al., 2019).\n\nIt's worth noting that while third-party libraries can alleviate development through code reuse, they have been found to be a major source of bugs and security vulnerabilities  (14, Derr, 2017). Therefore, ongoing validation of vulnerability characteristics and targeted detection and remediation of vulnerabilities in used third-party libraries are vital for maintaining software security  (50, Xing et al., 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods involve compartmentalizing libraries into separate processes with defined security policies, significantly reducing shared memory and potential attack surfaces.\n\nLibrary isolation and sandboxing provide robust protection against vulnerabilities and potential malicious code in third-party libraries. One approach, demonstrated by Sandcrust, focuses on protecting Rust-based main programs from unsafe code in libraries by moving the unsafe library code to a separate process where it can be sandboxed  (12, Weinhold et al., 2017). This method helps maintain the memory safety and control-flow integrity guaranteed by the Rust compiler.\n\nA more comprehensive solution is offered by Cali, which protects applications from vulnerabilities and backdoors in third-party libraries by compartmentalizing them into their own processes with well-defined security policies  (32, Bauer et al., 2021). Cali has shown impressive results, reducing the amount of memory shared between the program and library to as low as 0.08% for ImageMagick and 0.4% for Socat, while maintaining acceptable program performance.\n\nFor mobile applications, LibCapsule provides complete confinement of third-party libraries in Android apps, covering static Java code, dynamically loaded code, and native code  (39, Yang et al., 2022). This solution enables fine-grained regulation of third-party libraries according to customized security policies with low performance overhead.\n\nThe principle of least privilege is a key concept in library isolation. By deriving isolation policies based on program-specific knowledge, it's possible to protect applications from untrusted libraries more effectively  (48, Castes et al., 2023). This approach ensures that libraries only have access to the resources they absolutely need to function, minimizing the potential attack surface.\n\nBy implementing these isolation and sandboxing techniques, developers can significantly reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries compromising the security of their software. These methods provide an additional layer of protection beyond vulnerability detection and assessment, offering a proactive approach to library security.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(12, Weinhold et al., 2017) | n_citations: 40 | Sandcrust: Automatic Sandboxing of Unsafe Components in Rust ]: \nSandcrust is to protect the Rust-based main program from unsafe code in libraries, which would otherwise void the memory safety and control-flow integrity guaranteed by the Rust compiler...

[(48, Castes et al., 2023) | n_citations: 1 | Creating Trust by Abolishing Hierarchies ]: \nIt relies on program-specific knowledge to derive isolation policies following the principle of least privilege, e.g., to enable the protection of applications from untrusted libraries\n\n\n\nCode Validation and Filtering\nTLDR: Code validation and filtering techniques are crucial for protecting software against vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. These methods involve inserting security checks, debloating libraries, and implementing security policies to intercept and control access to sensitive operations.\n\nOne effective approach to mitigate vulnerabilities from third-party libraries is to implement code validation and filtering techniques. Smith et al. propose inserting LangSec validation filters around vulnerable internal modules to ensure that any crafted input attacks requiring syntactically invalid input are blocked before reaching the module  (1, Smith et al., 2020). This method shifts the focus from traditional security approaches that primarily harden the outer boundary of the main program to securing the boundaries between the main program and its libraries.\n\nAnother strategy involves debloating libraries to reduce the number of dynamic functions linked, thereby diminishing the possibilities of constructing malicious programs. Barua et al. suggest locating each library call site within an application and loading only the set of library functions that will be used at that specific call site  (20, Barua et al., 2019). This targeted approach can significantly reduce the attack surface by limiting the available functions that could potentially be exploited.\n\nFor mobile applications, particularly those using native libraries, NativeProtector offers a solution by instrumenting these libraries to intercept private data access and dangerous operations  (9, Wang et al., 2016). This interception allows for the implementation of various security policies to enforce safety measures on third-party native libraries, providing an additional layer of protection against potential vulnerabilities.\n\nFurthermore, Moving Target Defense (MTD) techniques can be employed to protect software vulnerable to information leaks, which often enable attacks such as return-to-libc and return-oriented programming (13, Nguyen-Tuong et al., 2017). By dynamically changing the software's attack surface, MTDs make it more challenging for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities consistently.\n\nThese code validation and filtering techniques, when combined with the vulnerability detection and library isolation methods discussed earlier, provide a comprehensive approach to protecting software against vulnerabilities from third-party libraries. By implementing these practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and enhance the overall security posture of their applications.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(1, Smith et al., 2020) | n_citations: 2 | Armor Within: Defending Against Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries ]: \nTo defend against these attacks, we \u2022 insert LangSec validation filters around the vulnerable internal module, \u2022 enforce that adversary-compromised code goes through these filters before reaching the module... We can be sure that any crafted input attack which requires the input to be syntactically invalid will not be able to exploit the software module... Traditional security considers hardening the outer boundary of the main program, and treats libraries as black boxes; preventing these attacks requires hardening the boundaries between the main program and the libraries.\n\n2. [(20, Barua et al., 2019) | n_citations: 7 | Binary Debloating for Security via Demand Driven Loading ]: \nIn this work, we create a defense mechanism by debloating libraries to reduce the dynamic functions linked so that the possibilities of constructing malicious programs diminishes significantly. The key idea is to locate each library call site within an application, and in each case to load only the set of library functions that will be used at that call site.\n\n3.

As we are able to insert hooking libraries which can intercept the private data access and dangerous operations to monitor the third-party native libraries, we can introduce the various security policies in NativeProtector to enforce security.\n\n4.

Implementing automated update processes and carefully evaluating replacements can significantly reduce vulnerabilities in software systems.\n\n1. Implement regular library updates: Third-party libraries in applications, especially mobile apps, have been identified as significant security risks  (10, Acar et al., 2017). Regularly updating these libraries is essential to address known vulnerabilities and improve overall security.\n\n2. Utilize drop-in replacements: Research has shown that 97.8% of actively used library versions with known security vulnerabilities could be easily fixed through drop-in replacements with fixed versions  (10, Acar et al., 2017). This approach offers a straightforward method to enhance security without extensive code changes.\n\n3. Evaluate library changes carefully: While updating libraries can eliminate security vulnerabilities, it's important to note that changes in libraries may also introduce new vulnerabilities or increase the attack surface  (33, Massacci et al., 2021). Therefore, careful evaluation of library updates is necessary before implementation.\n\n4. Prioritize production dependencies: Production dependencies should be given special attention in update strategies as they are considered the primary security liability in software systems  (40, Shihab et al., 2022). Focusing on these dependencies can have the most significant impact on overall system security.\n\n5. Implement automated update processes: To ensure timely updates and reduce the risk of overlooking critical security patches, consider implementing automated update processes for third-party libraries [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. This can help maintain consistent security standards across the software system.\n\n6. Consider library replacement alternatives: In cases where a library consistently poses security risks or lacks timely updates, evaluate alternative libraries that offer similar functionality with better security practices [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. This approach can help reduce long-term security vulnerabilities in the software.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(10, Acar et al., 2017) | n_citations: 140 | Keep me Updated: An Empirical Study of Third-Party Library Updatability on Android ]: \nThird-party libraries in Android apps have repeatedly been shown to be hazards to the users' privacy and an amplification of their host apps' attack surface... 97.8% out of 16,837 actively used library versions with a known security vulnerability could be easily fixed through a drop-in replacement of the vulnerable library with the fixed version.\n\n2. [(33, Massacci et al., 2021) | n_citations: 11 | Technical Leverage in a Software Ecosystem: Development Opportunities and Security Risks ]: \nWhile changes in own code may increase the attack surface, they normally also include eliminating bugs and security vulnerabilities in software libraries... In contrast, adding libraries only eliminates security vulnerabilities as a side effect if a version (or a whole library) without vulnerabilities is selected.\n\n3. [(40, Shihab et al., 2022) | n_citations: 7 | Not All Dependencies are Equal: An Empirical Study on Production Dependencies in NPM ]: \nProduction dependencies are the prime security liability in software systems since they can compromise a running software\n\n\n\nSecurity Policy Enforcement\nTLDR: Security policy enforcement is a crucial strategy for protecting software against vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. By implementing customized policies and compartmentalization techniques, developers can significantly reduce the attack surface and mitigate potential security risks.\n\nSecurity policy enforcement provides a robust framework for protecting software against vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. One effective approach involves implementing a policy enforcement infrastructure that supports web hardening techniques and access control policies on interactions between libraries and their environment  (19, Massacci et al., 2019). This method can prevent previously unknown vulnerabilities in libraries from being exploited and even allow for patching vulnerabilities when updating the library itself is not feasible.\n\nCompartmentalization is another powerful technique for enforcing security policies. Cali, for instance, protects applications by isolating libraries into separate processes with well-defined security policies  (32, Bauer et al., 2021). This approach has shown impressive results, reducing the shared memory between the program and library to as low as 0.08% for ImageMagick and 0.4% for Socat, while maintaining acceptable performance.\n\nFor mobile applications, particularly Android apps, LibCapsule offers a comprehensive solution for enforcing security policies on third-party libraries  (39, Yang et al., 2022). This tool provides complete confinement of libraries, including static Java code, dynamically loaded code, and native code. LibCapsule enables fine-grained regulation of third-party libraries according to customized security policies with low performance overhead.\n\nBy implementing these security policy enforcement techniques, developers can create a more secure environment for their software, effectively mitigating the risks associated with vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. These methods complement the vulnerability detection, library isolation, and code validation strategies discussed in previous sections, providing a comprehensive approach to software security.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Enforcing general policies, like, e.g., the anti-directory traversal policy, could also prevent previously unknown vulnerabilities in libraries from popping up... Another useful use case is patching of vulnerabilities in libraries when patching the library itself is not an option.\n\n2.

While teams quickly adapted, they faced challenges in communication, work-life balance, and maintaining project timelines.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on software projects worldwide, forcing a sudden and widespread shift to remote work  (19, Zimmermann et al., 2021). This abrupt transition has significantly altered the way software development teams collaborate, communicate, and manage projects  (20, Doering et al., 2021). The pandemic's effects on software development have been multifaceted, influencing various aspects of the software development lifecycle.\n\nOne of the most immediate and notable impacts was on team collaboration and communication. A study found that 74% of developers missed social interactions with colleagues, and 51% reported decreased communication ease  (19, Zimmermann et al., 2021). The shift to remote work introduced challenges in reaching milestones and affected team productivity  (19, Zimmermann et al., 2021). However, many teams demonstrated resilience by rapidly adapting their agile practices and roles to the new remote working environment  (1, Neumann et al., 2022).\n\nThe pandemic also influenced project timelines and development patterns. Research indicated a general decrease in the number of bug-fix commits per month during the pandemic period  (12, Gao et al., 2020). This suggests that software development under COVID-19 introduced additional challenges compared to pre-pandemic remote work scenarios  (12, Gao et al., 2020).\n\nFor software startups and newly created companies, the pandemic created a highly uncertain economic environment, putting pressure on time-to-market and necessitating quick adaptation to rapidly changing circumstances  (13, Marinho et al., 2020). The pandemic also accelerated the adoption of digital health solutions, presenting significant challenges for software development teams to swiftly adjust to new market needs and demands  (68, Nayebi et al., 2023).\n\nThe impact on agile software development practices was particularly noteworthy. Teams had to transition to distributed work, affecting the performance of agile software development teams and specific aspects of the agile approach  (21, Lier et al., 2021). Some organizations leveraged agile project management to adapt to the rapid changes in market demands caused by the COVID-19 quarantine  (89, Bandeira et al., 2024).\n\nWhile the pandemic posed numerous challenges, it also led to some positive outcomes. Many software development teams quickly adapted to the new circumstances  (73, Marques et al., 2023), and some even reported increased productivity in certain areas  (52, Sathe et al., 2022). The crisis also accelerated the adoption of new processes, practices, and technologies to support changes in product and service delivery  (80, Toffano et al., 2023).\n\nLooking forward, the pandemic experience has highlighted the need for software teams to be prepared for future disruptions and crises  (69, Ralph et al., 2023). Many organizations are now considering a combined approach of remote and onsite work post-pandemic  (1, Neumann et al., 2022), indicating a lasting impact on software development practices.\n\nIn conclusion, while the COVID-19 pandemic presented significant challenges for software projects, it also demonstrated the resilience and adaptability of software development teams. The experience has led to valuable lessons in maintaining team performance during disruptions and ensuring business continuity in the face of unforeseen circumstances.\n\nReferences:\n1.

While many teams adapted quickly, challenges emerged in maintaining social connections, managing productivity, and adjusting agile practices.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a rapid transition to remote work for software development teams, profoundly impacting collaboration and communication practices  (19, Zimmermann et al., 2021). This shift led to significant changes in how teams interacted and managed their work processes  (20, Doering et al., 2021). The sudden move to distributed work environments affected various aspects of team dynamics and agile methodologies  (21, Lier et al., 2021).\n\nOne of the most notable impacts was on social interactions and communication ease within teams. A study found that 74% of developers missed social interactions with colleagues, and 51% reported decreased communication ease  (19, Zimmermann et al., 2021). This social disconnect posed challenges for team cohesion and informal knowledge sharing, which are crucial in software development.\n\nDespite these challenges, many teams demonstrated resilience and adaptability. Some studies reported that a significant portion of developers maintained good productivity levels and motivation. For instance, one study found that 74.1% of participants considered their productivity to remain good or excellent, and 84.5% felt motivated and had easy communication with co-workers  (14, Andrade et al., 2020). However, external interruptions, environment adaptation, and emotional issues were identified as key factors influencing productivity in remote settings  (14, Andrade et al., 2020).\n\nThe pandemic particularly affected agile software development practices, which typically rely on face-to-face interactions and co-located teams  (26, Araujo et al., 2021). Agile teams had to quickly adapt their methodologies to distributed remote work, facing challenges in maintaining team performance and implementing specific agile practices (55, M\u00f6tefindt et al., 2022). For example, product backlog management became more challenging, with 37% of expert Scrum Team members noting that it needed attention due to difficulties in regularly managing tasks remotely  (66, Budiardjo et al., 2022).\n\nThe shift to remote work also necessitated changes in project management and development processes. Organizations accelerated the adoption of new practices, technologies, and tools to support changes in product and service delivery  (80, Toffano et al., 2023). This included increased use of video conferencing, chats, and cloud-based collaboration tools to replace direct face-to-face communication  (20, Doering et al., 2021).\n\nWhile the pandemic presented numerous challenges, it also led to some positive outcomes and learnings. Many software development teams quickly adapted to the new circumstances, demonstrating the industry's resilience  (76, Jnr., 2023). The experience has highlighted the importance of flexible work arrangements and the need for robust digital collaboration tools in software development  (81, Sobinska et al., 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered team collaboration and communication in software projects. While challenges in social interaction and certain agile practices emerged, many teams demonstrated remarkable adaptability. The experience has led to valuable insights into remote collaboration and the importance of flexible, resilient communication strategies in software development.\n\nReferences:\n1.

While facing challenges, many teams leveraged agile methodologies and digital tools to maintain productivity and even innovate in response to new market demands.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges for software development teams, forcing a rapid transition to remote work and necessitating significant adaptations in development practices  (1, Neumann et al., 2022). Despite these challenges, many teams demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability, quickly modifying their agile practices and roles to suit the new working environment  (1, Neumann et al., 2022).\n\nThe pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital health solutions, compelling software development teams to swiftly adjust to new market needs and demands  (68, Nayebi et al., 2023). This rapid change necessitated modifications in product management processes and development approaches  (68, Nayebi et al., 2023). Similarly, software startups faced increased pressure to address uncertainties quickly due to the volatile economic environment created by the pandemic  (13, Marinho et al., 2020).\n\nAgile methodologies proved particularly valuable during this time of upheaval. Many organizations leveraged agile project management to adapt to the rapid changes in market demands caused by the COVID-19 quarantine  (89, Bandeira et al., 2024). The inherent flexibility of agile approaches allowed teams to maintain continuous software deliveries, take ownership of their work, and quickly adapt to volatile situations  (52, Sathe et al., 2022).\n\nDespite the challenges, many software development teams maintained good productivity levels. One study found that 74.1% of participants considered their productivity to remain good or excellent, with 84.5% feeling motivated and having easy communication with co-workers  (14, Andrade et al., 2020). However, external interruptions, environment adaptation, and emotional issues were identified as key factors influencing productivity in remote settings  (14, Andrade et al., 2020).\n\nThe pandemic also spurred innovation in software development practices. For instance, a case study described the agile development of a web information system to manage ICU beds for COVID-19 patients, highlighting adaptations made to agile practices to cope with the urgency of pandemic times and remote teams  (32, Sampaio et al., 2021). This demonstrates how teams not only adapted existing practices but also innovated to meet new, urgent needs.\n\nWhile the transition was not without its challenges, with some studies noting a decrease in bug-fix commits during the pandemic period  (12, Gao et al., 2020), many Agile Software Development (ASD) teams transitioned to remote work without major issues, particularly those that had already been using remote working tools before the pandemic (41, \u00c5gren et al., 2022).\n\nThe pandemic experience has highlighted the importance of maintaining team performance during disruptions and ensuring that software teams can continue working during disasters, emergencies, and ongoing crises  (69, Ralph et al., 2023). It has also accelerated the development and deployment of new systems and technologies, driven by the necessities of the crisis  (40, Nerur et al., 2022).\n\nLooking forward, many organizations are considering a combined approach of remote and onsite work post-pandemic  (1, Neumann et al., 2022), indicating a lasting impact on software development practices. This shift suggests that the adaptations and resilience demonstrated during the pandemic will continue to shape the future of software development, emphasizing flexibility, digital collaboration, and robust crisis management strategies.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These events can lead to project cancellations, delays, or necessitate rapid adaptations in development processes and ecosystem dynamics.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has been a recent major external event affecting software projects, numerous other external factors have historically influenced software development:\n\n1. Economic Recessions: Economic downturns can have severe impacts on software projects. For instance, during a recession, a company cancelled a software project due to the severe impact on its business, rendering the system obsolete before implementation  (3, Salmela et al., 2000).\n\n2. Uncertainties and Unpredictable Events: Software delivery is often delayed due to uncertainties, risks, and unpredictable events that occur during project execution. These external factors account for five out of eight common reasons for late software delivery  (10, Minku et al., 2016).\n\n3. General Crises: Various types of crises have impacted software projects over the years, ranging from those causing catastrophic failures to others having minimal impact  (17, Zykov et al., 2020).\n\n4. Geopolitical Conflicts: Recent events like the War in Ukraine have demonstrated how world politics can significantly affect software ecosystems. For example, some maintainers took political stances in response to the conflict, leading to various effects on software projects and ecosystems  (53, Kula et al., 2022).\n\nThese examples illustrate that software projects are not isolated from broader world events and can be significantly impacted by various external factors, requiring adaptability and resilience from development teams.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These tools aim to integrate security into the development process and support developers in writing more secure code.\n\nSeveral types of tools are available to developers for detecting and managing vulnerabilities in software development. Static analysis tools, such as SonarQube, play a crucial role in identifying vulnerabilities early in the development process  (59, Wolf, 2021). These tools not only detect vulnerabilities but also explain their nature and provide appropriate next steps, enabling developers to write more secure code  (59, Wolf, 2021).\n\nPopular static code analysis tools like Cppcheck and S*** are widely used to detect bugs and vulnerabilities in software  (31, Zhou et al., 2019). Linters, a subset of static analysis tools, have great potential for automatically detecting and eliminating vulnerabilities (51, H\u0142yrup et al., 2020). However, it's important to note that while these tools can identify problems, they often lack the capability to fix them automatically  (52, Lesko, 2020).\n\nCoverage-based greybox fuzzing has proven effective in finding serious vulnerabilities in popular software  (33, Roychoudhury et al., 2019). This technique complements static analysis tools by focusing on dynamic testing of software.\n\nAutomated vulnerability assessment systems provide developers with reports on potential vulnerabilities in their applications, testing against the latest attack vectors  (118, Kirwan et al., 2023). Some advanced tools, like VuRLE, aim to not only detect but also automatically repair vulnerabilities, addressing multiple types of security issues (54, Heged\u0171s, 2020).\n\nDespite the availability of these tools, they remain underused. A survey of developers from 14 companies and 5 mailing lists revealed various reasons for not using security tools, highlighting the need for better integration and usability  (17, Welk et al., 2015).\n\nTo address this, newer approaches focus on integrating vulnerability detection and mitigation into the developer's workflow. For instance, some tools can detect known security vulnerabilities in running systems and support developers in closing these vulnerabilities within a DevOps approach  (117, Throner et al., 2023).\n\nThe motivation for developing these tools often stems from extensive research on vulnerabilities in open-source software. For example, SAP Security Research has been working since 2014 on analyzing vulnerabilities in open-source software, leading to approaches for detection, assessment, and mitigation of open-source vulnerabilities  (30, Dangremont et al., 2019).\n\nThese tools collectively aim to encapsulate security knowledge for vulnerability discovery, freeing developers from manually spotting security flaws during software development  (94, Wang et al., 2022). By integrating these tools into their workflows, developers and security analysts can more effectively identify vulnerabilities and mitigate open-source security risks  (72, Cakmak et al., 2021).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These resources range from comprehensive national databases to specialized datasets and knowledge graphs, providing essential information for vulnerability detection, analysis, and mitigation.\n\n- National Vulnerability Database (NVD): A widely recognized and comprehensive source for vulnerability information, maintained by NIST. It includes Common Vulnerability Enumerations (CVEs), vulnerability characteristics, and severity ratings  (115, Liang et al., 2023)  (62, Siow et al., 2021).\n\n- CVEfixes: A dataset supporting various types of data-driven software security research, including vulnerability prediction, classification, severity prediction, and analysis of vulnerability-related code changes  (60, Moonen et al., 2021).\n\n- GitHub Advisory DB, Snyk Vulnerability DB, and NPM Security Advisories: These databases provide continuous security monitoring services, collecting vulnerability reports for third-party packages  (109, Zhu et al., 2023).\n\n- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE): A community-developed list of common software and hardware weakness types, often used in conjunction with other databases to provide more comprehensive vulnerability information  (35, Eskridge et al., 2019).\n\n- SATE IV Juliet dataset: A popular software vulnerability detection dataset used for research and tool development  (92, Azim et al., 2022).\n\n- IBM's software vulnerability detection dataset: A collection of vulnerability data from various open-source projects  (92, Azim et al., 2022).\n\n- Vulnerability Knowledge Graphs: Advanced resources integrating diversified vulnerability key aspect information from heterogeneous vulnerability databases, supporting more in-depth investigation and understanding of vulnerabilities  (116, Xing et al., 2023).\n\n- Open-source project repositories: Platforms like GitHub provide valuable data on tool versioning and potential vulnerabilities in widely used libraries and frameworks  (119, Uzair et al., 2023).\n\nThese data sources and vulnerability databases serve as critical resources for developers and security researchers. They enable Software Composition Analysis (SCA), support the development of vulnerability detection tools, and help in identifying and mitigating security risks in software projects  (100, Jin et al., 2023). However, it's important to note that despite these extensive resources, many vulnerabilities and their corresponding security patches remain beyond public exposure, particularly in heavily relied-upon open-source libraries  (62, Siow et al., 2021). This underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and the use of multiple data sources to maintain software security.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(115, Liang et al., 2023) | n_citations: 0 | CompVPD: Iteratively Identifying Vulnerability Patches Based on Human Validation Results with a Precise Context ]: \nTo help application developers apply vulnerability patches, security researchers maintain vulnerability databases, e.g., National Vulnerability Database (NVD) [32], where a vulnerability report includes its identification number, Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE), its affected OSS, and its patch...

[(100, Jin et al., 2023) | n_citations: 13 | Understanding the Threats of Upstream Vulnerabilities to Downstream Projects in the Maven Ecosystem ]: \nThe basic intuition behind most of these tools is to perform Software Composition Analysis (SCA) by analyzing the dependency configuration file or the information gathered during compilation, and then search for vulnerable components referring to existing vulnerability databases (e.g., National Vulnerability Database (NVD)).\n\n\n\nIntegrated Development Environment (IDE) Support\nTLDR: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) play a crucial role in supporting developers' security efforts. Various tools and extensions for IDEs have been developed to help detect vulnerabilities, manage dependencies, and provide real-time security guidance during the coding process.\n\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs) are essential tools for software development, and their role in supporting security efforts has become increasingly important  (32, Tahaei et al., 2019). To address the security needs of developers, researchers have focused on improving existing tools and creating new security-focused extensions for IDEs.\n\nOne approach to enhancing security within IDEs is the integration of security modeling tools, vulnerability repositories, and development tools. This integration can provide comprehensive support for secure software development by helping developers prevent security problems early in the process (3, T\u00f8ndel et al., 2007). \n\nStatic analysis tools, when integrated into IDEs, can detect potential security defects early in the development cycle. However, resolving these issues can be challenging for developers. Research has been conducted to identify developers' information needs and strategies when addressing security vulnerabilities, aiming to improve the effectiveness of these tools  (28, Smith, 2018).\n\nTo address the complexity of security information, tools like Developer Companion have been created. This tool uses multiple static analysis tools to analyze code, cross-references results with the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and National Vulnerability Database (NVD), and presents developers with aggregated recommendations  (35, Eskridge et al., 2019).\n\nWeb Vulnerability Scanners (WVS) are another type of tool that can be integrated into IDEs to detect vulnerabilities in web applications. These tools, along with penetration testing, help developers identify and fix weaknesses, promoting better security practices in future development  (41, Gorle et al., 2019).\n\nManaging dependencies is a critical aspect of software security. Up2Dep, an Android Studio extension, supports developers in keeping project dependencies up-to-date and avoiding insecure libraries. In a study of 34 real projects, Up2Dep provided quick-fixes for 108 outdated dependencies and 8 dependencies with security issues  (47, Bugiel et al., 2020).\n\nTools like Dependabot and npm audit have become crucial for maintaining software security by alerting developers to vulnerabilities in dependencies as soon as they become high-threat level issues  (48, Alfadel et al., 2020).\n\nTo assist developers in addressing vulnerabilities comprehensively, tools like \"SecureChange\" have been developed. This tool suggests related files that might need modification when fixing a particular vulnerability, based on association rules mined from revision history  (57, Imtiaz et al., 2020).\n\nThese IDE integrations and extensions collectively aim to provide developers with real-time security guidance, vulnerability detection, and dependency management support, making it easier to write and maintain secure code throughout the development process.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(32, Tahaei et al., 2019) | n_citations: 71 | A Survey on Developer-Centred Security ]: \nSoftware is commonly written with the assistance of tools such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).Several research papers have endeavoured to understand the tool needs of developers, improve existing tools to better support security, or build new security-focused tools.\n\n2.

{"case_id": "baee287ff68f0fd60dcbd0d8b9b741b8", "answer_text": "Regularization effects beyond overfitting prevention\nTLDR: Dropout introduces complex regularization effects beyond just preventing overfitting. These effects include implicit learning rate decay for higher-order interactions, weight volume increases, and changes in weight orientations and optimization landscapes.\n\nDropout, a widely-used regularization technique in deep neural networks, exhibits several intriguing effects beyond its primary role in preventing overfitting  (32, Wei et al., 2020). One of the key findings is that dropout implicitly sets a learning rate for interaction effects that decays exponentially with the size of the interaction, effectively balancing against the hypothesis space that grows exponentially with the number of variables in the interaction  (1, RichCaruana et al., 2020). This perspective cautions against using dropout to measure term saliency, as it inherently regularizes against terms for high-order interactions.\n\nThe regularization effect of dropout is further enhanced when combined with other techniques. Hinton et al. demonstrated that using dropout along with maxnorm regularization, large decaying learning rates, and high momentum provides a significant boost in performance compared to using dropout alone  (5, Hinton et al., 2014). This combination of techniques suggests that dropout's regularizing effect is strong and can be complemented by other methods.\n\nRecent research has revealed that dropout introduces two distinct but entangled regularization effects: an explicit effect and an additional implicit effect from the stochasticity in the dropout training update  (32, Wei et al., 2020). This dual nature of dropout's regularization contributes to its effectiveness across various neural network architectures.\n\nInterestingly, dropout has been observed to lead to persistent and significant increases in weight volume across different models  (61, Jin et al., 2022). This effect appears to be quantitatively related to the dropout rate, suggesting a complex relationship between dropout and the network's weight space.\n\nZhang et al. found that training with dropout tends to condense input weights of hidden neurons on isolated orientations and leads to flatter minima in the optimization landscape compared to standard gradient descent training  (55, Zhang et al., 2022). This flatter minimum may contribute to improved generalization performance.\n\nDropout can also produce counterintuitive effects in certain scenarios. Helmbold et al. observed that dropout training can produce negative weights even when the output is the sum of the inputs, which is unexpected for fitting monotone behavior but necessary to control the variance induced by dropout  (9, Helmbold et al., 2016).\n\nThe interaction between dropout and the learning of high-order effects has been further elucidated by Caruana et al., who found that low rates of dropout can lead to massive overfitting due to reliance on high-order interactions. They also noted that different levels of dropout have different steady-state optima, and that early stopping is particularly effective when combined with dropout  (38, Caruana et al., 2020).\n\nThese diverse regularization effects of dropout provide new perspectives for explaining its effectiveness in various deep neural networks  (52, Li et al., 2021). The complex interplay between dropout and network behavior underscores the importance of understanding its multifaceted impact on neural network training and performance.\n\nReferences:\n1.

It also influences performance through various mechanisms, including enhanced robustness, increased modularity, and better emotion prediction in specific tasks.\n\nDropout introduces substantial changes to the structure and performance of neural networks. At its core, dropout randomly drops units and their connections during training, which prevents units from co-adapting too much  (3, Srivastava, 2013). This mechanism leads to sparse activations of hidden units, a key side-effect of standard dropout  (11, Park et al., 2017). Additionally, dropout has been found to be useful in avoiding dead neurons when using ReLU activation functions  (8, Park et al., 2016).\n\nThe impact of dropout on network performance is multifaceted. While it generally improves model generalization and robustness  (65, Sardar et al., 2023), there is ongoing research to achieve faster training convergence or better final performance  (23, Salehinejad et al., 2019). Variations of dropout, such as annealed dropout, have shown significant reductions in word error rates compared to standard dropout training  (6, Rennie et al., 2014).\n\nInterestingly, dropout has been observed to increase the modularity of neural networks  (35, Hod et al., 2020)  (40, Wild et al., 2020). This increased modularity may contribute to better interpretability of the network's inner workings. Furthermore, dropout has been found to enhance a network's resistance to adversarial attacks and increase the distribution of functional smearing across various dropout rates  (65, Sardar et al., 2023).\n\nIn specific applications, such as emotion prediction, higher regularization through dropout can lead to better results, particularly for valence prediction, by forcing the network to learn global patterns that generalize across speakers  (15, Parthasarthy et al., 2018).\n\nRecent research has introduced variations of dropout, such as neuron-specific dropout (NSDropout), which has shown promise in achieving similar or better testing accuracy with less data compared to traditional dropout and other regularization methods  (60, Shunk, 2022). Additionally, the choice between neuronal dropout and synaptic dropout (DropConnect) can impact performance, with neuronal dropout generally offering a higher performance-to-training-cost ratio  (68, Kreiman et al., 2023).\n\nIt's worth noting that dropout can have unexpected effects on network behavior. For instance, when used in combination with normalization techniques, dropout can lead to an increase in the number of spikes in spiking neural networks  (29, Cauwenberghs et al., 2019). The dynamic process of dropping and stepping-in units during training can also lead to changes in unit weights, potentially contributing to the network's adaptability  (69, Nandgaokar et al., 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(68, Kreiman et al., 2023) | n_citations: 0 | Synaptic Failure is a Flat Minima Optimizer ]: \nDropout can be applied to either the weights (synaptic Dropout/DropConnect (Wan et al., 2013)), or to neurons (Srivastava, 2013) (neuronal Dropout)... neuronal Dropout is the most commonly used form of Dropout and empirically has a higher performance-to-training-cost ratio (Wan et al., 2013), since synaptic Dropout requires averaging across an ensemble of networks.\n\n12.

Dropping and stepping-in few units seem to be very good process as those units which step-in will represent the network.\n\n\n\nInfluence on learning dynamics\nTLDR: Dropout significantly alters the learning dynamics of neural networks, affecting weight distributions, optimization landscapes, and activation patterns. It introduces stochasticity that can lead to flatter minima and sparser encodings, but its interactions with other techniques can be complex.\n\nDropout introduces a unique set of influences on the learning dynamics of neural networks. One of the most notable effects is its impact on the optimization landscape. Zhang et al. found that training with dropout leads to neural networks with flatter minima compared to standard gradient descent training  (55, Zhang et al., 2022)  (48, Zhang et al., 2021). This flatter minimum may contribute to better generalization, as it suggests a more stable solution that is less sensitive to small perturbations in the input or model parameters.\n\nThe stochasticity introduced by dropout also affects the variability of training trajectories. Eskandarian et al. observed that higher dropout rates lead to increased variance in weight trajectories during training  (54, Eskandarian et al., 2022). This increased variance can be both beneficial and challenging, potentially allowing the network to explore a wider range of solutions but also making convergence less predictable.\n\nDropout's influence extends to the distribution and behavior of network weights and activations. Zhang et al. reported that input weights of hidden neurons tend to condense on isolated orientations when trained with dropout  (55, Zhang et al., 2022). This effect on weight orientations may contribute to the formation of more robust and interpretable features within the network.\n\nInterestingly, variations of dropout can lead to different learning dynamics. Bhumbra introduced Quantal Synaptic Dilution (QSD), which outperforms standard dropout in ReLU multilayer perceptrons by enhancing sparse encoding at test time  (42, Bhumbra, 2020). This suggests that different forms of stochastic regularization can lead to distinct patterns of activation and information encoding within the network.\n\nThe interaction between dropout and other neural network techniques can produce unexpected results. Liu et al. found that combining neurogenesis with dropout consistently reduced performance, contrary to expectations  (57, Liu et al., 2022). This highlights the complex interplay between different regularization and architectural strategies in neural networks.\n\nHan et al. pointed out the inherent tension in dropout between optimizing for true data distribution and preventing overfitting through regularization  (10, Han et al., 2017). This tension underscores the need for careful tuning of dropout rates and consideration of its effects on overall learning dynamics.\n\nFinally, Coen-Cagli et al. drew interesting parallels between dropout and biological neural systems, suggesting that reducing dropout rate might correspond to increased synaptic reliability in attended states, albeit with reduced synaptic weights (51, Coen-Cagli et al., 2021). While speculative, this perspective offers intriguing insights into potential biological analogues of dropout's effects on learning dynamics.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(57, Liu et al., 2022) | n_citations: 8 | Adult neurogenesis acts as a neural regularizer ]: \nSurprisingly, neurogenesis, when combined with dropout, weight decay, or neural noise, consistently reduced the performance...

[(10, Han et al., 2017) | n_citations: 180 | Regularizing Deep Neural Networks by Noise: Its Interpretation and Optimization ]: \nInjecting noises to hidden units during training, e.g., dropout, is known as a successful regularizer, but it is still not clear enough why such training techniques work well in practice and how we can maximize their benefit in the presence of two conflicting objectives---optimizing to true data distribution and preventing overfitting by regularization.\n\n7. [(51, Coen-Cagli et al., 2021) | n_citations: 0 | Modeling Neural Variability in Deep Networks with ]: \nThe combined effect is that reducing the dropout rate slightly increases individual artificial neural activation (if they are not dropped out and have non-zero activation)... If there is a biological correspondence, it could be that during the attended state synaptic connections are more reliable (more neurons are active), but the synaptic weights are tuned down (less gain).\n\n\n\nEffects on uncertainty and robustness\nTLDR: Dropout has significant effects on model uncertainty estimation and robustness against adversarial attacks. While it can improve uncertainty quantification and enhance resistance to attacks, its implementation requires careful consideration to ensure well-calibrated confidence estimates.\n\nDropout's impact on uncertainty estimation and model robustness has been a subject of recent research, revealing both promising applications and potential challenges. One notable finding is the connection between dropout and Bayesian inference, which provides an efficient method for quantifying uncertainty in neural network models  (27, Sabuncu et al., 2019). However, this same study cautions that naive implementations of dropout, particularly in convolutional networks, can lead to poorly calibrated confidence estimates, highlighting the need for careful application of this technique.\n\nThe role of dropout in enhancing model robustness has been demonstrated in recent studies. Sardar et al. confirmed that dropout regularization can significantly improve a network's resistance to adversarial attacks  (65, Sardar et al., 2023). Their research also revealed an interesting side effect: dropout increases the distribution of functional smearing across various dropout rates, potentially contributing to the model's overall robustness.\n\nIn the context of privacy and security, dropout has shown promising effects. Recent publications suggest that dropout could protect shared gradients from gradient leakage, adding an extra layer of security to collaborative learning scenarios  (59, Scheliga et al., 2022). This finding expands the utility of dropout beyond its traditional role in regularization and uncertainty estimation.\n\nThe application of dropout in uncertainty representation has been explored in different neuron models. Standvoss demonstrated that sampling through dropout can effectively encode both epistemic uncertainty (incomplete world knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (noisy observations)  (31, Standvoss, 2019). This suggests that dropout's effects on uncertainty estimation are consistent across different neural architectures, further solidifying its importance in building robust and reliable models.\n\nThese findings collectively indicate that dropout's effects on uncertainty and robustness are multifaceted, offering benefits in model reliability and security while also presenting challenges in implementation and calibration. As research in this area continues, a nuanced understanding of these effects will be crucial for leveraging dropout effectively in diverse applications of deep neural networks.\n\nReferences:\n1.

We demonstrate that in cases of incomplete world knowledge (epistemic uncertainty) as well as for noisy observations (aleatoric uncertainty) both neuron models show similar uncertainty representations.\n\n\n\nLimitations and potential drawbacks\nTLDR: While dropout is effective for regularization, it can have negative impacts on performance in certain scenarios. These drawbacks include potential degradation of network stability, reduced accuracy in simpler models, and the need for careful tuning to avoid under-learning.\n\n- Degraded performance in certain architectures: Applying dropout to every feed-forward connection, especially at higher rates, can degrade the performance of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  (17, Jaf et al., 2018). Similarly, for simple neural networks, adding dropout can lead to worse performance by effectively making the network smaller  (39, Khodra et al., 2020).\n\n- Inconsistent benefits across model types: The effectiveness of dropout varies across different neural network architectures. While it can improve performance in some cases for Feedforward Neural Networks, its influence on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models is often minimal  (20, Liu, 2018).\n\n- Potential for network instability: High dropout rates may destroy the stability of the overall network structure, potentially negating the benefits of overfitting prevention  (46, Ma et al., 2021).\n\n- Performance trade-offs in specific applications: In Federated Learning scenarios, the use of dropout techniques like FedDrop can reduce communication overhead but at the cost of some performance loss compared to models without dropout  (43, Jeon et al., 2021).\n\n- Suppression of neuron activations: Dropout inherently hinders performance to some degree by suppressing neuron activations during training  (2, Rhanoui et al., 0).\n\n- Risk of under-learning: While dropout aims to prevent overfitting, there's a risk of under-learning if not properly tuned, leading to very poor system performance  (28, Mehndiratta et al., 2019).\n\n- Need for careful implementation: The effectiveness of dropout often depends on its specific implementation. Applying dropout at single lower layers (e.g., Embedding or Recurrent) and to the inputs and outputs of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers may be more beneficial than uniform application across all layers  (17, Jaf et al., 2018).\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "0348920a58979e759af9081a6225ee0d", "answer_text": "Pre-processing Bias Mitigation\nTLDR: Pre-processing bias mitigation techniques focus on addressing bias in the training data before model training begins. These methods offer early intervention but may have limitations in effectiveness compared to other stages.\n\nPre-processing bias mitigation techniques are applied to the training data before the model training process begins  (12, Kasneci et al., 2020)  (65, Chen et al., 2022). These methods aim to remove bias and unfairness early in the dataset or model inputs  (113, Rossi et al., 2023), offering the advantage of early intervention on pre-existing bias  (34, Zehlike et al., 2021).\n\nOne key advantage of pre-processing techniques is their ability to address bias at its source, potentially preventing it from being encoded into the model during training  (35, Rajan et al., 2021). This early intervention can make it easier to achieve fairness algorithmically compared to addressing bias later in the pipeline.\n\nPre-processing methods can include various approaches such as data transformation, augmentation, and sampling  (189, Chen et al., 2024). Specific techniques like Reweighing, Disparate Impact Remover, and Learning Fair Representations have been proposed  (114, Martin et al., 2023). Reweighting (RW) is a widely used pre-processing method that has shown good performance in balancing machine learning performance and fairness  (130, An et al., 2023).\n\nHowever, pre-processing methods also have limitations. For instance, RW is limited to considering only a single sensitive attribute when mitigating bias and assumes that each sensitive attribute is equally important  (130, An et al., 2023). Additionally, different pre-processing algorithms may employ varying concepts of fairness, which can lead to conflicting strategies and trade-offs between fairness and accuracy  (107, Collante et al., 2022).\n\nSome studies have shown that pre-processing methods can achieve good improvements in fairness with minimal reduction in accuracy  (148, Ramamurthy et al., 2023). However, the effectiveness of pre-processing techniques may vary depending on the specific dataset and problem context.\n\nIt's worth noting that while pre-processing methods offer advantages in terms of early intervention, they are often used in combination with other bias mitigation techniques. Some researchers have found that combining pre-processing with in-processing techniques can achieve the best performance in balancing model fairness and accuracy  (189, Chen et al., 2024).\n\nIn summary, pre-processing bias mitigation techniques offer the advantage of addressing bias early in the machine learning pipeline, potentially preventing it from being encoded into the model. However, their effectiveness may be limited by the complexity of bias in real-world datasets and the potential for conflicting fairness concepts. As such, they are often used as part of a multi-pronged approach to bias mitigation in machine learning systems.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods can be highly effective but may require more computational resources and careful balance with model performance.\n\nIn-processing bias mitigation techniques, also known as in-training methods, focus on reducing bias and unfairness during the model training process  (113, Rossi et al., 2023)  (65, Chen et al., 2022). These approaches act directly on the algorithm design, allowing for dynamic strategies to mitigate bias as the model learns  (188, Porrello et al., 2024)  (149, Chen et al., 2023).\n\nOne key advantage of in-processing techniques is their ability to handle bias introduced by the algorithm itself, which pre-processing methods cannot address  (197, Bessis et al., 2024). This is particularly important as deep neural networks are prone to learning spurious correlations between target classes and bias attributes inherent in training data  (198, Deng et al., 2024).\n\nIn-processing methods can include various approaches such as prejudice removal, adversarial debiasing, and discrimination-aware techniques  (114, Martin et al., 2023). Some specific techniques involve modifying learning algorithms to remove bias during training  (151, Chaudhary et al., 2023) or incorporating fairness as an additional constraint in the model optimization process  (84, Wang et al., 2022).\n\nStudies have shown that in-processing techniques can be particularly effective for models that initially show less bias  (14, Rajan et al., 2020). Additionally, some researchers have found that combining pre-processing with in-processing techniques can achieve the best performance in balancing model fairness and accuracy  (189, Chen et al., 2024).\n\nHowever, in-processing methods also have limitations. They often require more computational resources and can be more complex to implement compared to pre- or post-processing techniques [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. Additionally, there may be trade-offs between fairness and model performance that need to be carefully managed  (191, Soltan et al., 2024).\n\nIt's worth noting that the choice between pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing techniques often depends on the specific context and constraints of the problem. For instance, in-processing methods may be preferred when there is access to the model training process, while post-processing might be more suitable for black-box models  (149, Chen et al., 2023).\n\nIn summary, in-processing bias mitigation techniques offer the advantage of directly addressing bias during the learning process, potentially leading to more robust and fair models. However, their effectiveness must be balanced against computational costs and potential impacts on model performance. As such, they are often used as part of a comprehensive approach to bias mitigation in machine learning systems, potentially in combination with pre-processing or post-processing methods.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods offer flexibility and can be applied to black-box models, but may have limitations in addressing deeply embedded biases.\n\nPost-processing bias mitigation techniques are applied after a model has been trained, focusing on adjusting the predictions or outputs to reduce unfairness  (115, Eyre et al., 2023)  (65, Chen et al., 2022). These methods offer several advantages, particularly in situations where access to the training process or data is limited.\n\nOne key advantage of post-processing techniques is their flexibility and adaptability, especially when dealing with black-box AI models  (149, Chen et al., 2023). This makes them particularly useful in scenarios where the model's internal workings are not accessible or when there are constraints on modifying the training process  (148, Ramamurthy et al., 2023).\n\nPost-processing methods can include various approaches such as reject option classification and equalized odds postprocessing  (114, Martin et al., 2023). These techniques aim to modify the predictions generated by ML models to mitigate biased outcomes  (150, Zamzmi et al., 2023).\n\nInterestingly, studies have shown that post-processing techniques can be particularly effective for models that initially show more bias  (14, Rajan et al., 2020). This suggests that post-processing methods may be especially useful as a corrective measure for models that have already been trained and deployed but are found to produce biased results.\n\nHowever, post-processing methods also have limitations. They may be less effective at addressing deeply embedded biases that originate from the training data or the learning process itself  (36, Ruijsink et al., 2021). Additionally, there can be trade-offs between fairness improvements and model performance that need to be carefully managed [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nIt's worth noting that the choice between pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing techniques often depends on the specific context and constraints of the problem. Some researchers advocate for a multi-pronged approach, combining techniques from different stages to achieve optimal results in balancing fairness and accuracy  (113, Rossi et al., 2023)  (114, Martin et al., 2023).\n\nIn summary, post-processing bias mitigation techniques offer advantages in terms of flexibility and applicability to existing models, including black-box systems. They can be particularly effective for correcting bias in models that initially show higher levels of unfairness. However, their effectiveness may be limited when addressing biases deeply embedded in the model's learned representations. As such, they are often used as part of a comprehensive approach to bias mitigation in machine learning systems, potentially in combination with pre-processing or in-processing methods.\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "323e85c9052082358fc0c045fe20a537", "answer_text": "Correlation patterns between fairness metrics\nTLDR: Different fairness metrics tend to be highly correlated with each other across various datasets and model architectures. However, some exceptions exist, such as false negative rate parity, which can show negative correlations with other metrics.\n\nMultiple studies have consistently found strong correlations between different fairness metrics. Choudhary et al. observed that various group-conditioned fairness measures are closely related to each other, with base-rate measures like demographic parity and conditional demographic parity also showing strong correlations  (4, Choudhary et al., 2018). This finding is supported by P\u00e9rez et al., who reported that fairness rankings produced by different metrics tend to be correlated, particularly for gender bias [15 | 220483093 | P\u00e9rez et al. | 2020 | Citations: 35].\n\nThe high correlation between fairness metrics appears to be a robust phenomenon. Tolan et al. examined eleven group fairness metrics and found them to be highly correlated, aligning with previous research  (16, Tolan et al., 2020). Gursoy et al. conducted a comprehensive empirical study using ten fairness metrics across three datasets and three correlation measures, concluding that these correlations hold regardless of the dataset or correlation measure used  (68, Gursoy et al., 2023). They suggest that these correlations stem from the underlying definitions and semantics of the fairness metrics themselves.\n\nTo quantify these relationships, Chen et al. calculated Pearson Correlation coefficients between different fairness metrics across multiple datasets  (81, Chen et al., 2024). While most metrics show strong positive correlations, it's important to note that exceptions exist. Demartini et al. found that while most fairness metrics were highly correlated when controlling for dataset, model, and data quality metric, false negative rate (FNR) parity stood out as being negatively correlated with other metrics  (63, Demartini et al., 2023).\n\nThese findings suggest that while many fairness metrics capture similar aspects of algorithmic fairness, researchers and practitioners should be aware of potential discrepancies, particularly when considering metrics like FNR parity. The consistent correlations across different studies, datasets, and model architectures indicate that these relationships are fundamental to the nature of the metrics rather than artifacts of specific experimental setups.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(4, Choudhary et al., 2018) | n_citations: 566 | A comparative study of fairness-enhancing interventions in machine learning ]: \nA first surprising observation is that the various group-conditioned fairness measures are very closely related to each other (the base-rate measures like DI and CV are also closely related for the reason mentioned above).\n\n2.

Metrics' correlations hold across different choices of datasets and different notions of measuring correlation (e.g., Spearman, Pearson, Kendall).This implies that the correlations are typically due to the underlying definitions and semantics of the fairness metrics.\n\n4. [(81, Chen et al., 2024) | n_citations: 1 | A Large-scale Empirical Study on Improving the Fairness of Deep Learning Models ]: \nTo more clearly understand the relations between different fairness metrics, we have calculated the Pearson Correlation coefficient [86] across different metrics over all datasets.\n\n5. [(63, Demartini et al., 2023) | n_citations: 2 | On the Impact of Data Quality on Image Classification Fairness ]: \nThe fairness metrics we considered were all generally extremely correlated when controlling for dataset, model, and data quality metric, except for FNR parity which was negatively correlated.\n\n\n\nFactors affecting metric correlations\nTLDR: Several factors influence the correlations between fairness metrics, including the dataset, model type, and evaluation method. Understanding these dependencies is crucial for selecting appropriate metrics and interpreting fairness results.\n\n1. Dataset and model dependency: Correlations between fairness metrics are not universal but depend on the specific dataset and model type used  (1, Asudeh et al., 2021)  (2, Anahideh et al., 2021). This suggests that the choice of representative fairness metrics should be context-specific.\n\n2. Metric incompatibility: Not all fairness metrics are compatible with each other, as they may quantify fairness in different and sometimes conflicting ways  (62, Jourdan et al., 2023). This incompatibility can affect the observed correlations between metrics.\n\n3. Evaluation method: The way a model is evaluated can significantly impact its fairness score, even for the same metric  (64, Kern et al., 2023). This highlights the importance of consistent evaluation procedures when comparing fairness across different models or studies.\n\n4. Fairness concept: The type of fairness being measured (e.g., group fairness vs. individual fairness) can affect metric correlations. Some metrics, like Conditional Equality Violation (CEV) and Subset Discrimination Error (SDE), are specifically designed for group fairness and may not correlate well with individual fairness measures  (29, Huish et al., 2021).\n\n5. Joint consideration of performance and fairness: Some metrics, such as the fair efficiency metric, evaluate both classification performance and fairness simultaneously  (32, Lima et al., 2021). The use of such composite metrics can influence the observed correlations with other standalone fairness measures.\n\n6. Metric definitions and semantics: As mentioned in the previous section, the underlying definitions and semantics of fairness metrics contribute to their correlations [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. This factor interacts with the others listed above to determine the overall correlation patterns observed in practice.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(1, Asudeh et al., 2021) | n_citations: 4 | On the Choice of Fairness: Finding Representative Fairness Metrics for a Given Context ]: \nIn this paper, we proposed to identify representative fairness metrics for a given context (data and model).The underlying assumption behind this proposal is that correlations are data and model dependent.\n\n2.

[(64, Kern et al., 2023) | n_citations: 1 | One Model Many Scores: Using Multiverse Analysis to Prevent Fairness Hacking and Evaluate the Influence of Model Design Decisions ]: \nIndeed, both models can achieve a perfect score of 0 on the fairness metric, only by varying how they are evaluated.\n\n5.

We also believe our insights from CEV/SDE can be used to create standalone metrics to measure bias and fairness without making direct model comparisons.\n\n6.

This variability highlights the importance of comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets and metrics to ensure robust fairness assessments.\n\nThe correlation patterns and trade-offs between fairness metrics and model performance exhibit substantial variability across different datasets and model architectures. Several studies have demonstrated this variability, emphasizing the need for comprehensive evaluation strategies.\n\nIslam et al. observed that while fairness approaches often improve metrics they don't explicitly target, this effect can depend on the specific dataset used  (26, Islam et al., 2021). This finding is corroborated by Ermakova et al., who noted significant variations in metric correlations across datasets  (70, Ermakova et al., 2023). These observations underscore the importance of testing fairness interventions on multiple datasets to ensure their generalizability.\n\nThe choice of model architecture also plays a crucial role in fairness outcomes. Pan et al. found that certain fair model architectures, such as DFM-F and ADM-F, consistently outperformed traditional models in terms of both accuracy and fairness metrics across various datasets  (25, Pan et al., 2021). Similarly, Qingquan et al. demonstrated that ensemble-based approaches like EnsBest can achieve superior fairness performance compared to other architectures  (38, Qingquan et al., 2022).\n\nThe relationship between different types of fairness is also complex and dataset-dependent. Frermann et al. found that empirical fairness and representational fairness are not necessarily associated, with this trend consistent across two benchmark datasets  (37, Frermann et al., 2022). This highlights the need to consider multiple fairness concepts when evaluating models.\n\nTo capture this variability, researchers have employed diverse evaluation strategies. Memarrast et al. and Liu et al. conducted experiments using standard fairness datasets (e.g., Adult, COMPAS) and multiple fairness definitions to provide a comprehensive assessment  (74, Memarrast et al., 2023)  (75, Liu et al., 2023). Quy et al. specifically focused on analyzing variations and correlations of fairness measures across different datasets and predictive models  (50, Quy et al., 2022).\n\nThe sensitivity of fairness metrics to dataset characteristics is another important consideration. Kamp found that certain fairness metrics can be more sensitive to fluctuations in the evaluation dataset compared to traditional performance metrics  (54, Kamp, 2022). This sensitivity underscores the need for robust evaluation procedures when assessing fairness across different contexts.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have proposed more comprehensive evaluation frameworks. Kulshrestha et al. compared the effects of different fairness metrics at various fairness thresholds across multiple datasets, providing a more nuanced understanding of metric behavior  (30, Kulshrestha et al., 2021)  (31, Kulshrestha et al., 2021). Similarly, White et al. conducted experiments using multiple fairness datasets and definitions to capture a broader range of fairness scenarios  (21, White et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the variability of fairness metric relationships across datasets and model architectures emphasizes the need for comprehensive evaluation strategies. Researchers and practitioners should consider multiple datasets, fairness definitions, and model architectures to ensure robust and generalizable fairness assessments in machine learning systems.\n\nReferences:\n1.

It affects transistor performance, enables complementary FET designs, and influences device reliability.\n\nDoping is a cornerstone technique in semiconductor engineering that profoundly impacts integrated circuit (IC) design. At its core, doping involves intentionally introducing impurities into semiconductor materials to modify their electrical properties. A classic example is the addition of phosphorus atoms to bulk silicon, which creates an n-type semiconductor by introducing energy states close to the conduction band  (11, Dalpian et al., 2011). This process is essential for creating the basic building blocks of ICs, such as Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFETs), which are prized for their scalability in integrated circuits  (12, Nair et al., 2011).\n\nThe efficiency and stability of doping are critical factors in the performance of large-scale ICs, particularly in the realization of complementary FET designs  (40, Liu et al., 2022). Doping techniques continue to evolve, with recent advancements exploring novel methods such as surface treatment doping. For instance, p-type degenerate doping of WSe2 FETs has been achieved through NOx chemisorption surface treatment, illustrating the ongoing innovation in doping processes for emerging semiconductor materials  (35, Chen et al., 2020).\n\nDoping also plays a crucial role in addressing reliability issues in IC design. For example, the lightly doped drain (LDD) structure is employed in peripheral gates of pMOS and nMOS transistors to mitigate hot carrier-induced degradation. Additionally, double-well structures with optimized doping concentrations in well regions are used to enhance the characteristics of short-channel pMOS transistors  (1, Wada et al., 1990). These techniques demonstrate how careful manipulation of doping profiles can significantly impact device performance and longevity in IC design.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(11, Dalpian et al., 2011) | n_citations: 47 | Computational studies of doped nanostructures ]: \nPhosphorus atoms added to bulk silicon represents an archetypical example of an n-type semiconductor; phosphorous induces defect energy states very close in energy to the conduction band.\n\n2.

A double-well structure is adopted to improve the characteristics of short-channel pMOS transistors by optimizing the concentration of well regions.\n\n\n\nDoping-Related Reliability Issues\nTLDR: Doping-related reliability issues, particularly Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) and Hot Carrier Injection (HCI), significantly impact the performance and lifespan of integrated circuits. These effects become more pronounced in nanoscale designs, necessitating careful consideration in IC design processes.\n\nAs integrated circuit technology advances into the nanoscale era, doping-related reliability issues have become increasingly critical in IC design. Two dominant degradation mechanisms that have emerged are Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) and Hot Carrier Injection (HCI)  (13, Hamdioui et al., 2012). BTI, particularly Negative BTI (NBTI) in PMOS transistors, has been identified as one of the most serious aging mechanisms affecting the reliability of logic gates and limiting the lifetime of nanoscale ICs  (9, Wang et al., 2009)  (10, Pan et al., 2010).\n\nNBTI causes an increase in the threshold voltage (Vt) of PMOS transistors over time, which can lead to degraded performance and potential circuit failures  (7, Kang et al., 2007). This effect is exacerbated by higher operating temperatures and increasing vertical oxide fields in modern IC designs. The impact of NBTI is particularly notable in SRAM cells, where it can degrade read stability while improving write stability and standby leakage  (7, Kang et al., 2007).\n\nHCI, on the other hand, primarily affects NMOS transistors and occurs near the drain end due to accelerated 'hot' carriers in the channel  (18, Nabavi et al., 2013). Both NBTI and HCI contribute to the overall aging of VLSI circuits by causing drift in threshold voltage and degradation of carrier mobility  (15, Kamal et al., 2012).\n\nThese reliability issues have significant implications for IC design. For instance, NBTI can lead to increased clock skew in clock distribution networks due to non-uniform degradation of clock buffers  (10, Pan et al., 2010). Furthermore, the combined effects of BTI and HCI can impact circuit performance over time, potentially causing timing errors and functional failures  (44, Ortstein et al., 2023)  (26, Ubar et al., 2016).\n\nTo address these challenges, various approaches have been developed. Reliability simulators, such as BERT, have been created to model and predict circuit degradation due to hot-electron effects and oxide breakdown  (2, Li et al., 1993). Modern processors now integrate error detection and recovery circuits to protect against timing errors, parametric variations, aging, and voltage drops  (21, of et al., 2015).\n\nIn the design process, it has become necessary to apply aging simulations and develop aging-aware standard cell libraries for robust circuit design  (32, Crocoll et al., 2018)  (42, Wang et al., 2023). Additionally, techniques for estimating transient fault rates that consider both environmental noise and NBTI effects have been developed to provide a basis for fault mitigation techniques  (27, Li et al., 2016).\n\nAs technology continues to scale down, the significance of these doping-related reliability issues is expected to increase, posing ongoing challenges for CMOS devices  (29, Sun et al., 2017)  (30, Guan et al., 2017). This underscores the importance of addressing reliability concerns throughout the design space exploration process, particularly at higher levels of abstraction, to improve overall IC reliability  (45, Kalra et al., 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1.

It involves running numerous simulations with randomly varied parameters to estimate yield, but can be computationally intensive.\n\nMonte Carlo (MC) sampling is a fundamental and widely-used technique for yield estimation in automated electronic circuit design  (50, Tiwary et al., 2006)  (86, Wang et al., 2012). This method involves running multiple simulations of a circuit design, where each simulation represents a possible outcome of the fabrication process with randomly varied parameters  (20, Richard et al., 1991) (132, \u015eandru et al., 2022).\n\nThe popularity of MC sampling stems from its accuracy and generality  (71, Liu et al., 2010)  (127, Passos et al., 2021). It is often considered the gold standard for yield prediction, providing reliable results without requiring model approximations  (122, Shi et al., 2019). In a typical MC analysis, the circuit's performance is evaluated through full transistor-level SPICE simulations for each randomly generated sample point  (66, Tasiran et al., 2008).\n\nHowever, the main drawback of traditional MC sampling is its computational intensity (134, Moreno-Mojica et al., 2022). To achieve statistically significant results, a large number of simulations are usually required, which can be time-consuming, especially for complex circuits. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various acceleration methods, such as two-stage estimation flows and the use of object-oriented (OO) technology to allocate samples more efficiently  (71, Liu et al., 2010).\n\nDespite its computational challenges, MC sampling remains a crucial tool in yield estimation for automated electronic circuit design, providing a benchmark against which other methods are often compared.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods include various forms of importance sampling, Latin Hypercube sampling, and quasi-Monte Carlo techniques.\n\n\u2022 Importance Sampling: This technique constructs an improved Monte Carlo estimator for yield estimation, providing the same accuracy as standard Monte Carlo but with fewer simulations. A hybrid importance sampling approach has been developed for yield optimization of circuits with a large number of input variables  (4, Beelen et al., 2018). Additionally, mixture importance sampling (MixIS) has been used to accelerate 6\u03c3 variation analysis in cryogenic circuit design  (138, Chakraborty et al., 2023).\n\n\u2022 Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS): LHS is widely used to generate sample points in parameter space for circuit performance evaluation  (67, Wang et al., 2009). Studies have shown that LHS can provide significant speedup over traditional Monte Carlo analysis while maintaining high accuracy  (85, Garitselov et al., 2012).\n\n\u2022 Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) Sampling: QMC techniques use low-discrepancy sequences to generate samples, potentially improving convergence rates compared to crude Monte Carlo methods  (96, Edwards et al., 2013). QMC has been combined with behavioral models of analog circuits to speed up the yield estimation process  (126, Qui et al., 2020).\n\n\u2022 Line Sampling: This approach has been proposed to accelerate transistor-level timing yield analysis, offering an alternative to importance sampling methods  (107, Awano et al., 2016).\n\n\u2022 Varying-Sigma Sampling: A novel yield analysis method using varying-sigma sampling has been developed to quickly determine better designs in analog circuits yield optimization  (133, Yan et al., 2022).\n\n\u2022 High-Dimensional Kernel Density Estimation: This method finds data boundary points through high-dimensional kernel density estimation, performing simulations on these boundary values instead of overall simulation  (139, Zhou et al., 2023).\n\n\u2022 Hybrid Approaches: Researchers have proposed combining different sampling techniques to leverage their respective strengths. For example, a method combining Latin Hypercube and Low Discrepancy sampling has been developed to exploit the benefits of both approaches  (115, Zimmermann et al., 2017).\n\nThese advanced sampling methods often provide significant improvements in efficiency compared to traditional Monte Carlo techniques, with some studies reporting 3\u201310X reduction in confidence interval ranges of estimated yield, translating to 9\u2013100X reduction in the number of samples required for the same analysis accuracy  (78, Jaffari, 2010). However, the choice of sampling method often depends on the specific circuit design and analysis requirements  (3, Gong et al., 2014).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods can significantly speed up yield estimation while maintaining accuracy comparable to traditional Monte Carlo techniques.\n\nModel-based approaches offer an efficient alternative to simulation-intensive sampling methods for yield estimation in automated electronic circuit design. These techniques use mathematical models to represent circuit behavior, reducing the computational burden associated with numerous simulations.\n\nOne fundamental model-based approach consists of four key steps: simulation point selection, model fitting and validation, model improvement, and parametric yield estimation  (16, Trick et al., 1987). This method has shown that accurate statistical performance models and parametric yield estimates for MOS VLSI can be derived using just four or five critical device parameters and a small number of circuit simulations.\n\nAnother technique propagates the spread of technological variables through an analytical model to estimate circuit performance variables  (31, Debyser et al., 1998). This approach significantly reduces CPU time for yield estimation compared to Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining comparable accuracy.\n\nRecent advancements include the use of adaptive delay models and Low-Rank Tensor Approximation (LRTA) to model delay variation from numerous process parameters  (131, Shi et al., 2021). This method iteratively calibrates the model using an adaptive nonlinear sampling algorithm, further reducing the need for expensive transistor-level simulations.\n\nBayesian optimization techniques have also been applied to yield estimation, transforming the problem into identifying design parameters with maximal probability density  (124, Yang et al., 2020).

{"case_id": "2345ff0aa0b13fc87a46d5528be46060", "answer_text": "Types of tree compression algorithms\nTLDR: Tree compression algorithms can be categorized into three main approaches: using subtree repeats, using tree pattern repeats, and using succinct data structures. Top tree compression is a notable technique that can outperform other methods in certain scenarios.\n\n(6, Goertz et al., 2013) identifies three major approaches to tree compression:\n\n1. Using subtree repeats\n2. Using tree pattern repeats\n3. Using succinct data structures\n\nAdditionally, the authors introduce top tree compression as a notable technique. Top tree compression has some significant advantages:\n\n- It can compress exponentially better than DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) compression in some cases.\n- It is never worse than DAG compression by more than a logarithmic factor.\n\nThese characteristics make top tree compression a versatile and potentially powerful method for compressing tree structures.\n\n[LLM MEMORY | 2024] While not explicitly mentioned in the provided reference, it's worth noting that other tree compression algorithms exist, such as:\n\n4. Grammar-based compression\n5. Run-length encoding for trees\n6. Wavelet tree compression\n\nHowever, the effectiveness and computational complexity of these methods may vary depending on the specific tree structure and application.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(6, Goertz et al., 2013) | n_citations: 48 | Tree Compression with Top Trees ]: \nThe previous work on tree compression can be described by three major approaches: using subtree repeats, using tree pattern repeats, and using succinct data structures... We show that top tree compression (iv) can compress exponentially better than DAG compression, and (v) is never worse than DAG compression by more than a log n factor.\n\n\n\nComputation complexity comparisons\nTLDR: Tree compression algorithms vary significantly in their computational complexity. While some algorithms like BzTree offer lower complexity for operations like node splitting, others like RFC and RFC+ trade higher time complexity for improved compression.\n\nThe computational complexity of tree compression algorithms can vary significantly depending on the specific approach and implementation. For node splitting operations, which are crucial in many tree-based data structures, the BzTree algorithm demonstrates lower cyclomatic complexity (CC) compared to other approaches. Specifically, the CC of node split algorithms in BzTree and Bw-tree are 7 and 12, respectively, while MassTree has a notably higher CC of 19  (14, Levandoski et al., 2018). This lower complexity in BzTree can potentially lead to more efficient operations in certain scenarios.\n\nHowever, when considering overall compression performance, algorithms with higher time complexity may offer better results. For instance, the RFC (Run-length Fibonacci Compression) and RFC+ algorithms, while having a higher time complexity than the NEST (Nested Substructure Tree) algorithm, provide significantly improved compression properties  (11, Azais et al., 2016). The NEST algorithm operates in O(height(T)^2 * deg(T)) time, where T is the tree, height(T) is the tree's height, and deg(T) is the maximum degree of any node in the tree. In contrast, RFC and RFC+ algorithms, despite their higher complexity, outperform NEST in terms of compression efficiency, especially for small binary trees.\n\nIn the context of Functional-Structural Plant Models (FSPMs), reducing computational complexity often involves compressing plant branching structures. One approach is to use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for representing tree structures, which can be done in either a lossless or approximate manner  (12, Boudon et al., 2016). This method aims to reduce algorithm complexity by changing the scale of plant representation, potentially offering a balance between computational efficiency and accurate structural representation.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of algorithm often involves a trade-off between computational complexity and compression efficiency. While some algorithms may offer lower complexity for specific operations, others may provide better overall compression at the cost of increased computational demands.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(14, Levandoski et al., 2018) | n_citations: 135 | BzTree: A High-Performance Latch-free Range Index for Non-Volatile Memory ]: \nCC of the node split algorithms in BzTree and Bw-tree are 7 and 12, respectively... For example, we found that the cyclomatic complexity of the node split algorithm in MassTree is 19, which is more than two times that of the BzTree complexity of 7\n\n2. [(11, Azais et al., 2016) | n_citations: 6 | Approximation of trees by self-nested trees ]: \nDespite the fact that small binary trees framework is the most favourable to NEST solution, our compression procedures perform better than this algorithm... As a conclusion, the RFC and RFC + algorithms have a higher time-complexity than NEST that is in O(height(T ) 2 * deg(T )) time, but provide very much improved compression properties.\n\n3. [(12, Boudon et al., 2016) | n_citations: 1 | Reducing algorithm complexity in trees ]: \nDifferent strategies have been considered to reduce this computational complexity and they most of them make use of a change of scale in the plant representation... we present a new way of reducing algorithm complexity in FSPMs by compressing plant branching structures representation at a given scale... we make use of the possibility to compress tree branching structures as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) either in a lossless or approximate manner\n\n\n\nPerformance trade-offs\nTLDR: Tree compression algorithms often balance compression efficiency against computational complexity and lookup times. While some methods achieve significant compression, they may introduce additional processing overhead or slightly increased access times.\n\nThe performance of tree compression algorithms involves trade-offs between compression efficiency, computational complexity, and data access speed. Top tree compression demonstrates a favorable balance in some scenarios. According to  (9, Raman et al., 2015), their implementation of classical top tree compression was significantly faster than TreeRePair, running 10.5 times faster on average. Even when using a RePair combiner, it maintained a 6.2 times speed advantage. Notably, classical top tree compression only took twice as long as gzip -9 on average, highlighting its computational efficiency.\n\nHowever, achieving high compression ratios can come at the cost of increased lookup times.  (20, Samaan et al., 2020) found that their FCTrees approach achieved significant memory compression compared to traditional hash table and trie methods, but at the expense of a slight increase in lookup time. This trade-off is particularly evident in their DiFCTree and StFCTree variants, which employ additional compression techniques that impact Longest Prefix Match (LPM) time.\n\nThe choice of compression method can also affect the overall performance characteristics.  (6, Goertz et al., 2013) introduces top tree compression as a method that can offer exponentially better compression than Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) compression in some cases, while never being worse than DAG compression by more than a logarithmic factor. This suggests that top tree compression provides a good balance between compression efficiency and computational overhead across various scenarios.\n\nIn practice, the selection of a tree compression algorithm should be based on the specific requirements of the application, considering factors such as the desired compression ratio, acceptable computational complexity, and tolerable impacts on data access speed.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This integration of communication, localization, and sensing will enable intelligent context-aware networks capable of optimizing deployment, operation, and energy usage with minimal human intervention  (1, Bourdoux et al., 2020)  (89, Wang et al., 2021).\n\nA key enabler of context-awareness in 6G will be the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These technologies will allow 6G networks to automatically provide mobile positioning services and create 3D radio environment maps  (29, Saad et al., 2019). AI will also enable the development of intelligent and autonomous radios, enhancing the network's ability to adapt to changing conditions and user needs (39, Noor-A-Rahim et al., 2020).\n\nThe architecture of 6G networks is expected to evolve to support these context-aware capabilities. This includes the adoption of more open architectures with software-defined core networks and radio access networks  (38, Chen et al., 2020). Additionally, 6G will likely incorporate edge and fog computing resources to provide more user-aware, scalable, and low-latency services, particularly for applications like vehicular networks (39, Noor-A-Rahim et al., 2020).\n\nReconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are expected to play a significant role in enhancing context-awareness in 6G. These surfaces can be used to influence channel conditions and coverage maps, potentially achieving near line-of-sight quality in challenging environments  (165, Sharma et al., 2023). This environmental awareness will allow the network to act as an active component in the 6G system, providing better control over stochastic parameters in wireless systems  (165, Sharma et al., 2023).\n\nThe integration of positioning and sensing information with communication functionality is expected to yield several benefits. This includes the optimization of control operations, such as shaping beamforming patterns, reducing interference, and predicting handovers  (32, Giordani et al., 2019). Furthermore, this integration will enable proactive resource allocation and improve overall system sustainability by efficiently utilizing resources and infrastructure for multiple purposes  (171, Wymeersch et al., 2023).\n\n6G networks are also expected to support real-time sensing and adaptation of their operations, particularly at higher frequencies  (124, Hoyhtya et al., 2022). This capability, combined with the higher sampling rates enabled by high-frequency communications, will lead to improved transmission quality and the potential for advanced applications such as indoor positioning  (146, Xue et al., 2022)  (129, Akbar et al., 2022).\n\nIn summary, context-aware networking in 6G will leverage a combination of advanced technologies, including AI, edge computing, RIS, and integrated sensing and communication capabilities.

This integration will enable high-accuracy localization services alongside data transmission, supporting novel applications and optimizing network performance.\n\nThe integration of positioning and communication functionalities is expected to be a key feature of 6G wireless systems  (31, Chowdhury et al., 2019). This convergence will enable networks to provide high-accuracy localization services alongside traditional data transmission, opening up possibilities for new applications and improved network performance.\n\nOne of the approaches to achieve this integration involves exploiting the propagation characteristics of different frequency bands. For instance, techniques have been proposed to use sub-6GHz signals to improve beamforming speed for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications in mobile networks  (37, Wu et al., 2020).

[17] and Jaimovitch-Lopez et al. [18].\n\n\n\nEffectiveness of LLMs in Schema Matching\nTLDR: LLMs have shown promising results in schema matching tasks, often outperforming traditional methods. Their effectiveness stems from their ability to understand semantics and context, though challenges remain in fine-tuning and domain-specific applications.\n\nInitial research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema matching and related tasks has demonstrated encouraging results. The effectiveness of LLMs in these areas is primarily attributed to their capacity to comprehend and interpret the semantics and context of data schemas  (2, Mishaeli et al., 2024). This ability makes LLMs a powerful and scalable alternative to current state-of-the-art methods for entity matching and related tasks  (1, Matentzoglu et al., 2023).\n\nStudies comparing LLM-based matchers to pre-trained language model (PLM)-based matchers have shown that LLMs possess a general capability to perform entity matching across various datasets. In contrast, PLM-based matchers tend to be more closely fitted to entities of specific datasets after fine-tuning  (15, Bizer et al., 2023). This generalization ability of LLMs is particularly valuable in diverse schema matching scenarios.\n\nThe comprehensive understanding of language semantics and structures that LLMs possess, coupled with the knowledge acquired through training on vast amounts of text data, enables them to effectively identify errors, anomalies, and matches in textual data  (14, Zhang et al., 2023). This capability extends to the analysis of database schema elements, where LLMs can extract information on data properties from schema text, potentially guiding tuning and profiling efforts  (16, Trummer, 2023).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the effectiveness of LLMs in schema matching is still being explored, and challenges remain in fine-tuning these models for specific domains and ensuring consistent performance across various schema matching scenarios (LLM MEMORY, 2024). As research in this area progresses, we can expect further improvements in the application and effectiveness of LLMs for schema matching and related database tasks.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Their ability to understand and generate structured queries and analyze complex data patterns has opened up new possibilities in database management and interaction.\n\n- Text-to-SQL: LLMs have shown promising results in generating SQL queries from natural language inputs. Recent studies have explored how LLMs can support reasoning on multiple types of structured data, including tables, knowledge graphs, and databases  (9, Jiang et al., 2023). LLMs have demonstrated the capability to generate suitable SQL queries directly from database information provided as prompts  (9, Jiang et al., 2023). This advancement has led to improved performance on various text-to-SQL benchmarks  (5, Trummer, 2021).\n\n- Natural Language Database Interfaces: LLMs can be effectively used to construct natural language database interfaces, including conversational interfaces. These models can analyze structured data through augmented text-to-SQL capabilities, making database interaction more intuitive for users  (18, Nascimento et al., 2023).\n\n- Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA): LLMs have shown potential as semantic parsers in KBQA tasks, with their ability to understand the schema of given knowledge bases  (19, Li et al., 2023).\n\n- Schema Induction: Research has examined how well LLMs perform schema induction tasks, which involve understanding and generating structured representations of data  (20, Pustejovsky et al., 2023).\n\n- Data Discovery and Integration: LLMs have been applied to data discovery and integration tasks, leveraging their language understanding capabilities to identify relationships between different data sources  (5, Trummer, 2021).\n\n- Database Diagnosis and Tuning: The use of LLMs is being explored for database diagnosis and data tuning tasks, potentially improving the efficiency of database management systems  (22, Sun et al., 2024).\n\n- Semantic Pattern Matching: LLMs like GPT-3 have been employed for semantic pattern matching in databases, allowing for more sophisticated query refinement using logical predicates  (13, Chen et al., 2023).\n\n- Data Preparation: LLMs have shown potential in various data preparation tasks, helping to streamline the process of cleaning and organizing data for analysis  (5, Trummer, 2021).\n\nThese applications demonstrate the versatility of LLMs in database-related tasks, leveraging their language understanding and generation capabilities to improve various aspects of database management and interaction  (11, Xu et al., 2023). However, challenges remain in scaling LLMs for large databases and optimizing their performance for specific database tasks  (25, Cinquin, 2024).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Future research directions include improving LLM efficiency, developing specialized models for database tasks, and creating synergies between LLMs and database systems.\n\nThe application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to database tasks, including schema matching, presents both exciting opportunities and significant challenges. As research in this area progresses, several key challenges and future directions have been identified:\n\n1. Scaling and Efficiency: A major challenge lies in applying LLMs at scale to large databases. This includes identifying suitable pre-trained LLMs as starting points and optimizing LLM prompting and fine-tuning for efficient record analysis  (25, Cinquin, 2024). Future research will need to focus on developing methods to apply sequences to LLMs efficiently and improve tokenization techniques for database-specific tasks  (26, Sun et al., 2024).\n\n2. Specialized Model Development: While general-purpose LLMs have shown promise, there's a need for models tailored specifically to database tasks. This may involve developing specialized architectures or fine-tuning strategies that better capture the nuances of schema matching and other database operations (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\n3. Integration with Database Systems: A significant challenge and opportunity lies in creating a synergistic relationship between LLMs and database systems. This includes using database techniques to improve the quality of LLMs and, conversely, leveraging LLMs to optimize database tools  (11, Xu et al., 2023). Developing seamless pipelines to interface LLMs with databases is a crucial step in this direction  (25, Cinquin, 2024).\n\n4. Prompt Engineering: Optimizing prompt design for database-specific tasks is an important area for future research. This includes developing strategies to effectively communicate database schema information and query requirements to LLMs  (26, Sun et al., 2024).\n\n5. Evaluation and Benchmarking: As LLMs are increasingly applied to database tasks, there's a need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks and benchmarks specific to these applications. This will help in assessing the true effectiveness of LLMs compared to traditional methods and guide future improvements (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\n6. Ethical and Privacy Considerations: As LLMs are applied to sensitive database tasks, addressing privacy concerns and ensuring ethical use of these models becomes crucial. Future research will need to focus on developing privacy-preserving techniques for LLM-based database operations (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nAddressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions will be crucial in fully realizing the potential of LLMs in database management and schema matching tasks. The integration of LLMs with database techniques has the potential to open up new opportunities for research and advancement in the field of data science  (11, Xu et al., 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "948b6cb986a5d7732722975dbed9d420", "answer_text": "Evaluation Metrics and Methods\nTLDR: Evaluation of complex scientific question answering systems involves a range of metrics and methods, from traditional lexical matching to more sophisticated semantic similarity approaches. While standard metrics like F1 and exact match are still widely used, there's a growing recognition of their limitations and a shift towards more nuanced evaluation techniques.\n\nThe evaluation of complex scientific question answering (QA) systems in natural language processing (NLP) employs a variety of metrics and methods, each with its own strengths and limitations. Traditional evaluation approaches often rely on lexical matching techniques, such as exact match (EM) and F1 scores  (1, Hashimoto et al., 2019)  (86, Jiang et al., 2023). These metrics, along with top-n-accuracy, have been widely used due to their simplicity and ease of implementation  (57, Risch et al., 2021).\n\nHowever, as QA tasks become more complex and require more nuanced responses, the limitations of these traditional metrics have become apparent. Researchers have noted that simple lexical matching can be easily gamed and may not accurately reflect the quality of generated answers  (53, Krishna et al., 2021). This has led to a growing interest in more sophisticated evaluation approaches.\n\nOne emerging trend is the use of semantic similarity-based metrics. These methods leverage trained models to assess whether a system's response is semantically equivalent to the gold standard answer, rather than relying solely on exact string matches  (82, Lu et al., 2023). For instance, the BERT matching (BEM) measure has been proposed as a way to approximate human judgment of answer equivalence  (3, Bulian et al., 2022).\n\nAnother approach gaining traction is the use of entailment-based and question answering-based metrics. These methods aim to evaluate the factual consistency of generated answers by assessing a QA model's ability to answer questions derived from the input document using the generated summary  (54, Liu et al., 2021).\n\nResearchers have also explored the development of new metrics specifically designed for QA tasks. For example, the Semantic Answer Similarity (SAS) metric has been proposed to address the shortcomings of existing lexical-based metrics  (57, Risch et al., 2021).\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of evaluation metric can significantly impact the perceived performance of QA systems. Studies have shown that human judgments of answer quality often diverge from scores assigned by automated metrics  (48, Yoon et al., 2020)  (31, Chen et al., 2019). This has led some researchers to advocate for a combination of multiple evaluation metrics to provide a more comprehensive assessment of QA model performance  (96, Engelbach et al., 2023).\n\nWhile automated metrics continue to evolve, many researchers still consider human evaluation to be the gold standard for assessing complex QA systems. Human judgment has been shown to provide a more nuanced assessment of answer quality, with some studies reporting up to a 23% increase in perceived performance compared to automated metrics  (84, Dziri et al., 2023).\n\nAs the field of complex scientific QA continues to advance, the development of reliable and informative evaluation metrics remains a crucial area of research. These metrics not only help identify issues with current models but also influence the development of future generations of QA systems  (77, Mustafazade et al., 2022).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These datasets vary in complexity, domain coverage, and task types, reflecting the evolving challenges in the field.\n\nThe evaluation of complex scientific question answering systems relies heavily on diverse benchmark datasets.

Many researchers argue that human judgment remains the best way to evaluate QA systems comprehensively  (4, Farea et al., 2022). As the field progresses, new benchmarks are continually being developed to address the evolving challenges in complex scientific question answering.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Various approaches have been developed, including structured evaluation frameworks, direct model-human interactions, and using language models as examiners.\n\nHuman evaluation continues to be a vital component in assessing the performance of complex scientific question answering systems, offering insights that automated metrics often fail to capture. Researchers have developed several approaches to leverage human judgment effectively in evaluation processes.\n\nOne structured approach involves using \"Decision Points\" as a framework for evaluation. Walker et al. propose a method where human judges evaluate specific slices of complex data that represent coherent decision-making moments. This approach allows for accurate, timely, and actionable evaluations of complex semantic artifacts  (17, Walker et al., 2010).\n\nDirect interaction between human evaluators and QA systems has also proven valuable. Goenka et al. conducted a large-scale human evaluation of conversational QA systems, where evaluators engaged in conversations with models and judged the correctness of their answers. This method provides a more realistic assessment of system performance in interactive scenarios  (60, Goenka et al., 2021).\n\nSome researchers argue for evaluating QA systems based on their impact on downstream human performance. Boyd-Graber et al. suggest assessing how well humans perform tasks when using QA system outputs, rather than evaluating the systems directly (58, Boyd-Graber et al., 2021).\n\nRecent studies have explored using language models themselves as evaluators. Barnett et al. propose using a language model as a \"knowledgeable examiner\" to evaluate other models' responses to its questions. This approach has been applied to assess ChatGPT's performance on NLP tasks and to evaluate open-domain QA models  (94, Barnett et al., 2023).\n\nThe creation of human-annotated benchmarks has also proven valuable for developing and assessing automated evaluation methods. Zhang et al. developed a dataset of human evaluations that can serve as a benchmark for investigating which evaluation methods best correlate with human judgments in open-domain QA tasks  (89, Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nRecognizing the limitations of current automatic evaluation methods, some researchers have introduced new tasks specifically designed for human evaluation. Xu et al. proposed the QA Evaluation (QA-Eval) task, which aims to assess the accuracy of AI-generated answers in relation to standard answers within open-domain QA contexts  (90, Xu et al., 2023).\n\nWhile these human evaluation approaches offer valuable insights, they often require significant time and resources. As such, ongoing research continues to explore ways to balance the depth of human evaluation with the efficiency needed for rapid development cycles in complex scientific QA systems (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nReferences:\n1.

We introduce a new task, QA Evaluation (QA-Eval), designed to assess the accuracy of AI-generated answers in relation to standard answers within Open-QA. Our evaluation of these methods utilizes human-annotated results\n\n\n\nChallenges and Limitations in Evaluation\nTLDR: Evaluating complex scientific question answering systems faces numerous challenges, including reliability issues with performance metrics, the need for more nuanced assessment methods, and the difficulty of capturing multi-hop reasoning capabilities. These limitations highlight the ongoing need for improved evaluation techniques that can accurately reflect the true capabilities of QA systems.\n\nThe evaluation of complex scientific question answering systems in NLP presents several significant challenges and limitations that researchers continue to grapple with. One fundamental issue is the reliability of performance metrics. As Futrell points out, the common practice of comparing single-number performance metrics between models can be misleading, as small differences may not hold up under different training or evaluation conditions  (78, Futrell, 2022). This raises questions about the robustness and generalizability of reported improvements in QA systems.\n\nLeaderboards, while widely used in NLP to drive progress, have their own limitations. Rodriguez et al. argue for a reimagining of leaderboards to better highlight genuine progress, proposing a Bayesian model that accounts for latent subject skill and item difficulty  (56, Rodriguez et al., 2021). This approach aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of model performance beyond simple ranking.\n\nThe complexity of questions in scientific domains poses another significant challenge. Zaib et al. note that answering complex questions often requires advanced techniques such as iterative query generation, multi-hop reasoning, and question decomposition  (55, Zaib et al., 2021). Evaluating these sophisticated capabilities demands equally advanced assessment methods, which are not always captured by traditional metrics.\n\nTo address some of these limitations, researchers have explored alternative evaluation approaches. Xie et al. introduced a simulatability experiment to measure how well sub-question explanations can help humans predict model behaviors on complex tasks like HOTPOTQA  (74, Xie et al., 2022). This approach offers insights into model interpretability and the effectiveness of explanation methods, which are crucial for understanding and improving QA systems.\n\nThe rapid development of transformer-based models has further complicated evaluation efforts. Rawat et al. highlight the excellent performance of various transformer models on NLP benchmarks  (76, Rawat et al., 2022). However, this proliferation of high-performing models underscores the need for more discriminative evaluation techniques that can differentiate between subtle improvements and capture the nuanced capabilities of these advanced systems.\n\nAs the field of complex scientific QA continues to evolve, addressing these challenges and limitations in evaluation remains a critical area of research. Developing more robust, comprehensive, and nuanced evaluation methods will be essential for accurately assessing the true capabilities of QA systems and guiding future advancements in the field.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Is that difference reliable? If you used a slightly different dataset for training and evaluation, would that one point difference still hold?\n\n2.

Rather than replace leaderboards, we advocate a re-imagining so that they better highlight if and where progress is made... we create a Bayesian leaderboard model where latent subject skill and latent item difficulty predict correct responses.\n\n3.

It measures the difference between ideal and received symbols, providing insights into signal quality and system performance.\n\nError Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a widely used metric in the wireless industry and research community for assessing the quality of digital modulation in communication systems  (7, Parthasarathy et al., 2017). It is defined as the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the difference between measured symbols and ideal symbols, typically expressed as a percentage of the square root of the mean power of the ideal signal  (2, Chattopadhyay et al., 2009)  (3, Kumar et al., 2010).\n\nEVM provides a comprehensive measure of modulation accuracy by quantifying the error between transmitted and received symbols  (4, Khanzadi et al., 2013). It can be visualized and calculated using constellation diagrams, where the deviation of received constellation points from their ideal reference values is measured  (9, McKiernan, 2023).\n\nThe importance of EVM lies in its ability to characterize overall system performance, particularly in scenarios involving multipath fading and interference. For instance, in OFDM systems, which are susceptible to multipath fading, EVM can accurately assess link quality and network performance  (3, Kumar et al., 2010). Additionally, EVM has been shown to have a relationship with the signal-to-noise ratio (Eb/No), where an increase in Eb/No generally results in a decrease in EVM, indicating improved reception quality  (3, Kumar et al., 2010).\n\nIt's worth noting that EVM calculations may need to account for various factors depending on the system. For example, in systems with phase noise, accurate EVM calculation requires consideration of the conditional probability density function of the residual phase noise variance  (4, Khanzadi et al., 2013). Furthermore, in interference-limited systems, EVM can be related to the number of interferers and the fading conditions experienced by both the desired signal and interferers  (7, Parthasarathy et al., 2017).\n\nMany digital wireless communication standards specify maximum allowable EVM levels to ensure system linearity and performance  (2, Chattopadhyay et al., 2009). For example, the IEEE sets specific EVM limits for different modulation schemes and code rates  (9, McKiernan, 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(7, Parthasarathy et al., 2017) | n_citations: 14 | Error Vector Magnitude Analysis in Generalized Fading With Co-Channel Interference ]: \nError Vector Magnitude (EVM) is an alternate performance metric that is being increasingly employed in the wireless industry as well as in the research community... EVM expression is derived for an interference limited system when both the desired signal and interferers experience independent and non identical distributed (i.n.i.d) \u03ba-\u00b5 shadowed fading... It is analytically shown that EVM is equal to the square root of number of interferers when the interferers and desired signal do not experience fading.\n\n2.

The modulation accuracy can be quantified by the EVM, defined as the root-mean square error between the transmitted and received symbols... Note that to calculate the EVM accurately, we need to use the conditional PDF of the residual PN variance f (\u03b5[n]|s).\n\n5. [(9, McKiernan, 2023) | n_citations: 0 | Foundational Techniques for Wireless Communications: Channel Coding, Modulation, and Equalization ]: \nThe Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of how much a received constellation point deviates from the ideal reference value for a given modulation index & can be determined from the Constellation Diagram using (2).The maximum permissible EVM is set by the IEEE and for this system, 16-QAM modulation with \u00be code rate, is -19dB [4].\n\n\n\nEVM calculation methods for different modulation types\nTLDR: EVM calculation methods vary depending on the modulation scheme and system characteristics. Accurate EVM measurement requires consideration of factors like phase noise, interference, and specific modulation properties.\n\nThe calculation of Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is essential for assessing modulation accuracy in digital communication systems, but the methods can vary depending on the modulation type and system characteristics. For general modulation schemes, EVM is typically defined as the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the error between transmitted and received symbols, expressed as a percentage of the square root of the mean power of the ideal signal  (2, Chattopadhyay et al., 2009).\n\nHowever, in systems affected by phase noise, a more nuanced approach is necessary. Khanzadi et al. propose that accurate EVM calculation in such cases requires the use of the conditional probability density function (PDF) of the residual phase noise variance  (4, Khanzadi et al., 2013). This method accounts for the stochastic nature of phase noise and its impact on symbol distortion.\n\nFor systems dealing with interference, particularly in scenarios involving different waveforms like Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FB-MC) and Cyclic Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM), traditional power spectral density (PSD) based models for EVM estimation may be inadequate. Bodinier et al. demonstrate that a more precise estimation of EVM is necessary in these cases, suggesting the use of Monte-Carlo simulations to accurately capture the average EVM at the receiver  (6, Bodinier et al., 2017).\n\nIt's important to note that while a general equation for EVM can provide a baseline for comparison across different modulation types, the specific characteristics of each modulation scheme (e.g., MPSK, QPSK, MQAM) may necessitate tailored approaches for the most accurate EVM calculations (LLM MEMORY, 2024). This is particularly relevant when considering factors such as constellation density, which can affect the sensitivity of EVM measurements to various impairments.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Values predicted by the PSD-based model (righthand side) are compared to those obtained through Monte-Carlo simulations of the average EVM at the incumbent CP-OFDM receiver according to (22) (left-hand side).\n\n\n\nRelationship between EVM and Eb/No\nTLDR: EVM generally decreases as Eb/No increases, indicating improved signal quality. This relationship is crucial for assessing system performance and optimizing transmission parameters.\n\nThe relationship between Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) and Energy per Bit to Noise Power Spectral Density Ratio (Eb/No) is fundamental to understanding and optimizing digital communication systems. As Eb/No increases, EVM typically decreases, reflecting an improvement in signal quality and reception  (3, Kumar et al., 2010). This inverse relationship is particularly significant in systems prone to multipath fading, such as OFDM, where EVM serves as an accurate indicator of link quality and overall network performance  (3, Kumar et al., 2010).\n\nThe impact of EVM on system performance can be substantial. Vehkapera et al. demonstrate that typical target EVM values ensure the signal is at least 20-30 dB above the transmit-side noise  (5, Vehkapera et al., 2014). Their research also highlights the potential rate loss due to transmit noise, showing that an EVM of -20 dB can result in a noticeable performance degradation compared to an ideal case  (5, Vehkapera et al., 2014).\n\nAdvancements in transmission techniques can significantly improve EVM performance across different Eb/No levels. For instance, Huang et al. report a 10-20 dB reduction in EVM for QPSK signals using a modified transmission system compared to a time-invariant system  (8, Huang et al., 2021). This improvement in signal fidelity demonstrates the potential for enhancing EVM performance through innovative transmission methods.\n\nWhen analyzing the EVM vs. Eb/No curve, one should expect to see a decreasing trend in EVM as Eb/No increases. However, the exact shape and characteristics of this curve may vary depending on factors such as modulation type, system architecture, and the presence of interference or distortion (LLM MEMORY, 2024). It's important to consider that while a general equation for EVM can provide a baseline for comparison, the specific relationship between EVM and Eb/No may need to be evaluated individually for different modulation schemes and system configurations to account for their unique characteristics.\n\nReferences:\n1.

To see more clearly the effect of transmit noise, Fig. 3(b) shows the rate loss (in percents) for the case with transmit noise EVM dB = -20 when compared to the ideal case EVM dB = -\u221e.\n\n3.

Measured phase shift keyed waveforms transmitted using the modified system show significant increases in signal fidelity, including a 10\u201320-dB reduction in error vector magnitude compared to a time-invariant system.\n\n\n\nFactors affecting EVM measurements\nTLDR: EVM measurements are influenced by various system characteristics and environmental factors. Understanding these influences is crucial for accurate EVM calculation and interpretation across different modulation schemes and communication scenarios.\n\n1. Phase Noise: In systems affected by phase noise, accurate EVM calculation requires consideration of the conditional probability density function (PDF) of the residual phase noise variance. This stochastic approach accounts for the impact of phase noise on symbol distortion, leading to more precise EVM measurements  (4, Khanzadi et al., 2013).\n\n2. Interference: Traditional power spectral density (PSD) based models for EVM estimation may be inadequate in scenarios involving different waveforms, such as Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FB-MC) and Cyclic Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM). More precise EVM estimation techniques, like Monte-Carlo simulations, are necessary to accurately capture the average EVM at the receiver in these cases  (6, Bodinier et al., 2017).\n\n3. Transmit-side Noise: The level of transmit-side noise can significantly impact EVM measurements. Typical target EVM values ensure that the signal is at least 20-30 dB above the transmit-side noise. Higher levels of transmit noise can result in noticeable performance degradation, as demonstrated by the rate loss observed with an EVM of -20 dB compared to an ideal case  (5, Vehkapera et al., 2014).\n\n4. Fading Conditions: In interference-limited systems, the fading conditions experienced by both the desired signal and interferers can affect EVM measurements. When the desired signal and interferers experience independent and non-identical distributed (i.n.i.d) \u03ba-\u00b5 shadowed fading, the EVM expression needs to account for these specific fading characteristics  (7, Parthasarathy et al., 2017).\n\n5. Signal Power and Eb/No: EVM is inversely related to the Energy per Bit to Noise Power Spectral Density Ratio (Eb/No). As Eb/No increases, EVM typically decreases, indicating improved reception quality. This relationship is particularly important in systems prone to multipath fading, such as OFDM, where EVM serves as an accurate indicator of link quality and overall network performance  (3, Kumar et al., 2010).\n\n6.

The key difference lies in their data acquisition and the nature of information they provide.\n\nfMRI data are acquired as complex-valued images that record changes in cerebral hemodynamics over time  (4, Li et al., 2008) (20, Yu et al., 2021). This temporal dimension gives fMRI its distinctive characteristic of high-dimensional, small-sample data  (20, Yu et al., 2021). Typically, fMRI data are represented as a sequence of T2*-weighted images with lower spatial resolution than structural MRI, sampled every 2-3 seconds  (17, Bernstein et al., 2018).\n\nIn contrast, structural MRI provides static, high-resolution anatomical images of the brain  (21, Vergara et al., 2021). This fundamental difference in data acquisition leads to distinct statistical properties and analysis approaches for fMRI and sMRI datasets  (19, Hacker et al., 2020).\n\nIt's worth noting that while fMRI data are originally acquired as complex-valued images, most fMRI studies only use the magnitude of the data in their analyses, discarding the phase information  (4, Li et al., 2008) (7, COMON et al., 2012). However, there is growing interest in incorporating phase information into analyses, as it may improve sensitivity to functional changes  (2, Pearlson et al., 2002).\n\nAnother important distinction is that fMRI measures brain activity indirectly through the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which is subject to temporal blurring due to the hemodynamic response function  (10, Karahan et al., 2015). This indirect measure of neural activity contrasts with the direct structural information provided by sMRI.\n\nIn terms of connectivity analysis, fMRI data often show stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections, a property not typically observed in diffusion MRI (dMRI) data  (13, Priebe et al., 2017). This difference highlights the unique information captured by each modality and underscores the potential benefits of combining multiple modalities in brain analysis  (23, Saha et al., 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Over the past few years, interest in incorporating the phase information into the analyses has been growing and new methods for modeling and processing the data have been developed.\n\n8. [(2, Pearlson et al., 2002) | n_citations: 10 | On complex infomax applied to functional MRI data ]: \nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique which produces complex data; however the vast majority of functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses utilize only magnitude images...

Nearly all of the fMRI scans (99.4%) show stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections, whereas nearly none of the dMRI scans exhibit this property (7.7%)\n\n\n\nPreprocessing Steps\nTLDR: Preprocessing is crucial for both fMRI and MRI data, but fMRI requires more complex steps due to its temporal nature. These steps aim to correct for acquisition-related issues and prepare the data for analysis.\n\nThe preprocessing of fMRI data involves several complex steps that are critical for ensuring the quality and reliability of subsequent analyses  (22, Peide et al., 2022). These steps are generally more involved than those required for structural MRI data, primarily due to the temporal nature of fMRI acquisitions  (14, Morante et al., 2018).\n\nFor fMRI data, preprocessing typically includes motion correction, slice timing correction, spatial normalization, and temporal filtering  (16, Scott et al., 2018). These steps are designed to account for various detrimental effects related to the fMRI image acquisition process, such as subject movement, differences in slice acquisition timing, and physiological noise  (14, Morante et al., 2018).\n\nIn contrast, structural MRI preprocessing is generally simpler, focusing primarily on spatial normalization and tissue segmentation (LLM MEMORY, 2024). However, both modalities may require intensity normalization and artifact removal.\n\nIt's important to note that fMRI preprocessing also includes steps specific to its temporal nature, such as handling the time mode of the data. This is particularly relevant when the trial duration is less than the repetition time of fMRI acquisition  (22, Peide et al., 2022).\n\nAfter preprocessing, fMRI data analysis often involves additional steps such as regions of interest (ROI) identification and data extraction  (22, Peide et al., 2022). These steps are crucial for preparing the data for advanced analyses aimed at unmixing the measured signals to reveal brain-induced time courses and associated spatial maps  (14, Morante et al., 2018).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(22, Peide et al., 2022) | n_citations: 5 | Coupled support tensor machine classification for multimodal neuroimaging data ]: \nThere is no time mode in fMRI data because the trial duration is less than the repetition time of fMRI (time for obtaining a single 3D volume fMRI)... The fMRI data processing includes three major steps, which are pre-processing, regions of interests (ROI) identification, and data extraction... The pre-processing of EEG data is relatively easy comparing to fMRI\n\n2. [(14, Morante et al., 2018) | n_citations: 9 | Information Assisted Dictionary Learning for fMRI Data Analysis ]: \nThe aim of fMRI data analysis is to unmix the measured mixture in order to reveal the brain-induced time courses of interest and the associated spatial maps... prior to the formation of the data matrix, X, several standardized preprocessing steps are conducted in order to account for a number of detrimental effects related to the fMRI image acquisition process\n\n3. [(16, Scott et al., 2018) | n_citations: 5 | A Survey of FMRI Data Analysis Methods ]: \nFunctional MRI measures the physiological fluctuations in brain cells and relies on the fact that neurons with more activity consume more oxygen. The output of an fMRI scan is a series of raw images, meaning they contain errors... Hence, some preprocessing on the data is required to maximize the information that can be obtained from the images.\n\n\n\nAnalysis Techniques\nTLDR: Analysis techniques for fMRI and MRI data differ due to the nature of the data acquired. While MRI analysis focuses on structural features, fMRI analysis involves more complex methods to handle temporal and functional information.\n\nThe analysis techniques for fMRI and MRI datasets differ significantly, reflecting the distinct nature of the data they capture. For structural MRI, analysis typically focuses on anatomical features and may achieve higher classification accuracy in some cases. For instance, in a migraine study, structural MRI analysis achieved 68% classification accuracy, while fMRI analysis reached 81%  (15, Gaw et al., 2018). This suggests that both modalities offer unique insights, with fMRI potentially providing more sensitive measures for certain conditions.\n\nfMRI analysis techniques are generally more complex due to the need to handle both spatial and temporal information. Traditional fMRI analysis often involves creating correlation graphs or using voxel-by-voxel matching. However, newer approaches aim to overcome these limitations. For example, Rieck et al. proposed a coordinate-free method that operates directly on fMRI volumes, providing a stable representation of high-level brain activity without requiring voxel-by-voxel matching or correlation graphs  (18, Rieck et al., 2020).\n\nAnother advanced technique for fMRI analysis is cortical surface-based fMRI (cs-fMRI), which offers several advantages over volumetric fMRI. These include better whole-brain visualization, dimension reduction, removal of extraneous tissue types, and improved alignment of cortical areas across subjects. Importantly, cs-fMRI preserves the neurobiological relationships between nearby locations on the cortical surface, which may be lost in volumetric fMRI where Euclidean distance doesn't always correspond to neurobiological similarity  (12, Mejia et al., 2017).\n\nWhile structural MRI analysis primarily focuses on anatomical features, functional MRI analysis aims to correlate brain activity with specific tasks or stimuli. This allows researchers to estimate the relationship between particular activities and thematic brain regions, which is not possible with traditional MRI analysis alone  (9, Kaur et al., 2014).\n\nIn summary, the choice of analysis technique depends on the research question and the type of data available. While structural MRI analysis may offer more straightforward interpretations in some cases, fMRI analysis provides unique insights into brain function and connectivity, albeit with more complex analytical approaches.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(15, Gaw et al., 2018) | n_citations: 8 | A clinical decision support system using multi-modality imaging data for disease diagnosis ]: \nBecause the CV errors of MRI are lower than fMRI... It is important to note, in the single modality migraine study (Schwedt et al., 2015) where structural MR data were analyzed, the classification accuracy was 68%; and the single modality migraine study using fMRI data had 81% classification accuracy (Chong et al., 2016).\n\n2. [(18, Rieck et al., 2020) | n_citations: 43 | Uncovering the Topology of Time-Varying fMRI Data using Cubical Persistence ]: \nOur approach differs from existing approaches for fMRI data analysis in two crucial ways, namely (i) it is coordinate-free, providing a stable representation of high-level brain activity, even without a voxel-by-voxel match, and (ii) it does not require the creation of a correlation graph... Our method operates directly on fMRI volumes, requiring neither additional location information nor auxiliary representations.\n\n3. [(12, Mejia et al., 2017) | n_citations: 55 | A Bayesian General Linear Modeling Approach to Cortical Surface fMRI Data Analysis ]: \nCs-fMRI offers several advantages over volumetric fMRI, including better whole-brain visualization, dimension reduction, removal of extraneous tissue types, and improved alignment of cortical areas across subjects... Nearby locations in cs-fMRI are close in terms of distance along the cortex, and therefore tend to exhibit similar patterns of neuronal activity, while in volumetric fMRI locations that are close in terms of Euclidean distance may be neurobiologically quite dissimilar\n\n4. [(9, Kaur et al., 2014) | n_citations: 1 | fMRI Image Analysis using Pixel Neighborhood Segmentation Techniques ]: \nIn the existing MRI analysis, it never gives estimation about the correlation between particular activity the person is engaged in, and the brain thematic region... This can be approximated by statistically analyzing the MRI images after stimulated by engaging the person under scanner towards a target functional activity e.g. by giving some logical calculation.\n\n\n\nChallenges in Analysis\nTLDR: Both fMRI and MRI data analysis face significant challenges due to the complexity of the data and various confounding factors. fMRI analysis, in particular, encounters additional difficulties related to its temporal nature and the weakness of the signal.\n\nThe analysis of both fMRI and MRI datasets presents researchers with a range of challenges, though fMRI data analysis tends to be more complex due to its temporal dimension and the nature of the signal it captures. One of the primary difficulties in fMRI data analysis is the weakness of the signal itself (6, Jord\u00e3o et al., 2010). This weak signal is often accompanied by abundant noise in the data, making it challenging to distinguish genuine brain activations from other types of signal fluctuations.\n\nAnother significant challenge in fMRI analysis is the difficulty in separating activations of interest from other types of brain activity or artifacts (6, Jord\u00e3o et al., 2010). This issue is particularly pronounced in fMRI studies due to the complex nature of brain function and the indirect measure of neural activity through the BOLD signal.\n\nThe temporal aspect of fMRI data adds another layer of complexity to the analysis process. Unlike structural MRI, which provides static images, fMRI data captures brain activity over time, requiring more sophisticated analytical approaches to handle this additional dimension  (8, Mane et al., 2012).\n\nWhile structural MRI analysis may seem simpler in comparison, it still faces challenges related to image quality, anatomical variability among subjects, and the need for accurate segmentation and registration techniques (LLM MEMORY, 2024). However, these challenges are generally more manageable than those encountered in fMRI analysis.\n\nIn both cases, researchers must carefully consider these challenges when designing studies and interpreting results. The development of advanced preprocessing techniques and analysis methods continues to be an active area of research, aimed at improving the reliability and sensitivity of both fMRI and MRI data analysis.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(6, Jord\u00e3o et al., 2010) | n_citations: 0 | fMRI Data Analysis Techniques and the Self-Organizing Maps Approach ]: \nAlthough fMRI is a powerful tool to detect functional activation within the brain, the obtained data from fMRI experiments cannot be easily directed analyzed because of a number of factors: weakness of the signal, abundant noise in the data and the difficulty of separating activations of interest from other types.\n\n2.

Their performance improves with increased model size and specialized training data, though limitations remain.\n\nLanguage models, particularly large-scale ones, have shown remarkable proficiency in handling scientific tasks and generating technical content. These models, when pretrained on vast amounts of scientific text, can achieve impressive performance across a wide range of scientific and reasoning tasks  (40, Zhang et al., 2023). The effectiveness of these models tends to improve predictably as their size, training data, and computational resources increase  (21, Zhou et al., 2022).\n\nSome specialized models have demonstrated particularly strong results in scientific domains.

Their capacity to store, combine, and reason about scientific language makes them particularly useful for scientific applications (50, Garrido-Merch'an et al., 2023).\n\nIn the field of natural sciences, LLMs demonstrate strong generalization abilities, allowing them to tackle unseen or complex challenges  (68, Wan et al., 2023). They can also apply their extensive background knowledge to automate common data science tasks, such as detecting anomalies, describing potential reasons for these anomalies, and suggesting repairs  (97, Lengerich et al., 2023).\n\nSome models achieve superior performance in specific domains through sophisticated dataset design and domain-adapted tokenization. For example, certain models can handle citations and domain-specific modalities like chemical formulas and protein sequences by using task-specific tokens  (93, Retkowski, 2023).\n\nWhile these advancements are impressive, it's important to note that challenges and limitations still exist in the application of language models to scientific tasks (LLM MEMORY, 2024).

They show promise in tasks like protocol writing, survey generation, and hypothesis formulation, often approaching human-level performance in specific domains.\n\n- Language models can generate coherent and grammatically correct scientific text, making them valuable tools for various scientific writing tasks  (15, Gero et al., 2021).\n\n- These models can provide explanations for classification decisions, demonstrating their potential in interpreting complex scientific phenomena  (16, Riedl et al., 2021).\n\n- LLMs show the ability to generate novel text structures rather than simply copying existing content, indicating a level of linguistic abstraction and generalization  (17, Gao et al., 2021).\n\n- Models like SciBERT have shown promise in producing scientific explanations, contributing to knowledge dissemination and hypothesis generation  (118, Kumar et al., 2024).\n\n- In some cases, LLMs can surpass human experts in predicting experimental outcomes, suggesting potential for human-AI collaboration in scientific discovery  (125, Gu et al., 2024)  (70, Adesso, 2023).\n\n- LLMs demonstrate proficiency in inferring concepts from complex linguistic descriptions, indicating their potential for understanding and generating scientific content  (133, Zhang et al., 2024).\n\n- In biochemical tasks, LLMs show exceptional performance, particularly in translating between molecular structures and natural language descriptions  (134, Liu et al., 2024).\n\n- These models can generate and evaluate biological protocols, showcasing their potential in automating aspects of scientific methodology  (83, Abboud et al., 2023).\n\n- LLMs excel in crafting survey articles on scientific concepts, demonstrating their capability in synthesizing and presenting complex information  (111, Jiang et al., 2023).\n\n- The models can produce coherent text on a wide range of scientific topics, given sufficient training data and architectural optimization  (84, Alaniz et al., 2023).\n\n- Fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific datasets can significantly improve their performance in tasks like scientific text generation  (95, Goel et al., 2023).\n\n- Some models can generate fluent and largely accurate textual explanations from structured data, such as explainable output graphs  (106, Enshaei et al., 2023).\n\n- LLMs have shown near human-level performance in solving elementary physics word problems, especially when provided with similar examples  (107, Ding et al., 2023).\n\n- These models can automate scientific knowledge extraction, potentially alleviating the burden of manual information processing  (30, Hong et al., 2022).\n\n- LLMs demonstrate the ability to comprehend scientific abstracts and relate them to hypotheses, even without specific training on the task  (89, Koneru et al., 2023).\n\n- Specialized models can be developed to answer intricate questions in specific scientific domains, such as particle accelerator physics  (99, Sulc et al., 2023).\n\n- Some models can generate coherent and valid formal analyses of linguistic data, showcasing their metalinguistic abilities  (65, Rhodes et al., 2023).\n\n- LLMs offer a unique approach to explaining complex concepts by directly generating explanations  (54, Jangam et al., 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These include difficulties with specialized knowledge, abstract reasoning, and providing comprehensive information beyond given prompts.\n\n- Language models, while proficient in generating human-like text for general applications, often struggle with specialized scientific topics, particularly in fields like mathematics and chemistry  (130, Fauber, 2024).\n\n- In biomedical applications, scientific language models (SLMs) can process texts containing both human language and chemical structures. However, they perform poorly in zero-shot activity prediction tasks, indicating limitations in their ability to generalize scientific knowledge  (55, Seidl et al., 2023).\n\n- Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate texts that overly focus on given prompts, often failing to provide sufficient background and detailed information compared to human-generated content. This \"over-concentrated information\" problem limits their ability to produce comprehensive scientific descriptions  (112, Zhao et al., 2023).\n\n- Current LLMs face challenges in comprehending and utilizing abstraction knowledge, especially in zero-shot and few-shot settings. While training on rich abstraction knowledge can improve their performance, generalization to unseen events remains a significant hurdle  (79, Fang et al., 2023).\n\n- In the biomedical domain, even the best-performing models struggle to produce acceptable explanations of biomedical mechanisms, succeeding in only 32% of instances. This highlights the difficulty LLMs face in understanding and explaining complex scientific concepts  (36, Balasubramanian et al., 2022).\n\n- For highly specific scientific questions, smaller models (<10B parameters) fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets often outperform larger language models in terms of accuracy, relevancy, and interpretability. This suggests that general-purpose large language models may not always be the best choice for specialized scientific tasks  (38, Awasthi et al., 2022).\n\nReferences:\n1.

However, human-generated content still tends to surpass AI in terms of depth, detail, and overall quality.\n\nLanguage models have made significant strides in generating scientific content that closely resembles human-written text. Studies have shown that AI-generated scientific abstracts can be believable and original, without detectable plagiarism  (23, Luo et al., 2022). In some cases, it can be surprisingly difficult for reviewers to differentiate between AI-generated and human-written abstracts, although AI-generated content often appears vaguer and more formulaic  (23, Luo et al., 2022).\n\nLarge language models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in producing coherent, informative, and fluent natural language texts  (116, Galitsky, 2023). Some experiments have illustrated that these models can generate highly technical scientific texts that are credible and compelling  (60, Ridder et al., 2023).\n\nHowever, despite these impressive capabilities, there remains a gap between AI-generated and human-written scientific content. While AI has the potential to generate content that is as accurate as human-written material, it often falls short in terms of depth and overall quality  (52, Ma et al., 2023)  (61, YONGQIANG et al., 2023). AI-generated scientific content is more prone to errors in language redundancy and factual issues  (61, YONGQIANG et al., 2023).\n\nHuman evaluation of machine-generated summaries has shown that while some are comparable to human-written reviews, challenges persist. These include hallucinations and a lack of detailed information  (100, Kasanishi et al., 2023). Additionally, although AI-generated text may not be easily distinguishable from human-written text for crowd-sourcing workers, subtle errors in AI-generated content can be harder to spot  (52, Ma et al., 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, while AI models have made remarkable progress in generating scientific content, human-generated content still generally maintains an edge in terms of depth, accuracy, and overall quality. The ongoing challenge for AI systems is to bridge this gap while addressing issues such as hallucinations and lack of detailed information.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These tools show promise in automating and enhancing multiple stages of the scientific writing process, though their outputs still require human oversight.\n\n- Language models can assist in automating various aspects of scientific writing, including generating text for research papers, abstracts, and literature reviews  (131, Olshevska et al., 2024).\n\n- LLMs demonstrate capabilities in summarizing research literature, completing literature review tasks, and even creating full literature review articles. They also show potential in peer review processes, with their evaluations often aligning with those of human experts  (132, Research et al., 2024).\n\n- These models can be used to automatically evaluate the quality of generated texts, potentially streamlining the review process for scientific writing  (137, Tian et al., 2024).\n\n- LLMs have the potential to contribute significantly to scientific hypothesis generation by interpreting and exploiting current knowledge in a given scientific domain, effectively digesting relevant literature  (78, Abrahao et al., 2023).\n\n- Advanced applications of language models include generating novel scientific directions grounded in existing literature, moving beyond simple binary link prediction to more expressive hypothesis generation  (69, Wang et al., 2023).\n\n- Scientific articles themselves can serve as valuable training data for text summarization models, with titles and abstracts providing high-quality summaries at different levels of detail  (6, Nikolov et al., 2018).\n\n- Innovative techniques like \"impossible distillation\" allow for the creation of smaller, more efficient models that can outperform much larger language models in specific scientific writing tasks  (53, Jung et al., 2023).\n\n- Large pretrained language models have shown impressive results in generating free-text explanations, making them a competitive approach for writing explanations in scientific contexts  (35, Wu et al., 2022).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These representations can be automatically learned or synthesized from examples, enabling fine-grained task automation across various domains.\n\nDomain-Specific Languages (DSLs) play a crucial role in representing user demonstrations for automation tasks. These languages are designed to capture the essence of user actions in a concise and expressive manner, tailored to specific domains or applications  (14, Harris et al., 2012). One approach to representing demonstrations involves recursively summarizing them into a latent, compact specification, which can then be expanded into fully defined task code  (1, Sharma et al., 2023).\n\nDSLs can be used to represent a wide range of demonstrations, from spreadsheet operations to robot tasks. For instance, in the context of Excel spreadsheets, a synthesis algorithm can learn programs in a custom DSL from user-provided examples, enabling automated data manipulation  (14, Harris et al., 2012). Similarly, in robotics, a stack-based DSL has been introduced for object repositioning tasks, where programs are synthesized based on human demonstrations performed on a tablet interface  (18, Birchfield et al., 2014).\n\nThe representation of demonstrations in DSLs often involves translating user actions or natural language instructions into symbolic programs. This is exemplified by the Semantic Interpreter approach, which translates user utterances into ODSL programs for manipulating content and actions in Office applications  (119, Gandhi et al., 2023). These symbolic representations enable fine-grained control and reasoning about the demonstrated tasks.\n\nA notable advancement in this field is the use of neural architectures for program induction. These methods can learn mappings from input-output examples to automatically construct computer programs in a DSL, generalizing to new test inputs  (23, Parisotto et al., 2016). This approach bridges the gap between user demonstrations and executable code, making it easier to automate complex tasks.\n\nRecent research has also explored neuro-symbolic DSLs that combine pre-trained neural networks with symbolic reasoning constructs. This hybrid approach enables fine-grained image editing tasks by learning programs from user demonstrations, allowing for more sophisticated and context-aware automation  (117, Dillig et al., 2023).\n\nThe process of creating DSLs themselves has also been streamlined. Approaches have been developed to create DSLs from a set of domain model examples provided by end-users, addressing challenges in DSML development and making the creation of domain-specific representations more accessible  (15, Gray et al., 2012).\n\nIn summary, the representation of user demonstrations in DSLs involves creating compact, symbolic programs that capture the essence of user actions. These representations can be automatically learned or synthesized from examples, enabling sophisticated automation across various domains, from spreadsheet manipulation to robotic tasks and image editing.\n\nReferences:\n1.

To facilitate such fine-grained image editing tasks, we propose a neuro-symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) that combines pre-trained neural networks for image classification with other language constructs that enable symbolic reasoning... Our method can automatically learn programs in this DSL from user demonstrations by utilizing a novel synthesis algorithm.\n\n7.

To resolve issues related to DSML development, we introduce a new approach to create DSMLs from a set of domain model examples provided by an end-user.\n\n\n\nTypes of User Demonstrations for Automation Tasks\nTLDR: User demonstrations for automation tasks come in various forms, including natural language instructions, visual interactions, and physical actions. These demonstrations can range from simple input-output examples to complex sequences of actions, allowing both expert and non-expert users to teach machines new skills across diverse domains.\n\n1. Natural Language Instructions: Users can provide demonstrations through natural language descriptions, which are then translated into executable code or programs [35, 86]. This approach allows naive users to teach robots a wide variety of novel tasks without requiring programming expertise [35].\n\n2. Input-Output Examples: Demonstrations can be presented as pairs of input and expected output, often in a specific syntax that language models can parse and learn from [102, 110]. This method is particularly useful for teaching language models to perform specific tasks or use new tools [101].\n\n3. GUI Interactions: Users can demonstrate tasks by interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of applications. These demonstrations capture mouse-keyboard signals and screenshots, which are then used to synthesize automation scripts [24, 26, 49]. Systems like VASTA use computer vision techniques to label these interactions accurately [46].\n\n4. Mobile App Interactions: Some systems, like PUMICE, allow users to define concepts and teach new procedures through demonstrations with mobile apps, enabling end-users to create custom automations [42].\n\n5. Web Browser Actions: Demonstrations can involve chains of actions performed on web browsers, with each state representing the entire webpage document object model (DOM) [112]. These demonstrations can be used to generate prompts for language models to learn web-based tasks.\n\n6. Robotic Task Demonstrations: Users can demonstrate physical tasks to robots, which are then translated into robot code or action models [11, 30]. This approach, known as Robot Programming by Demonstration (PbD) or imitation learning, allows non-expert users to teach robots new skills without writing machine commands [77].\n\n7. Virtual Character Control: In some cases, users demonstrate tasks by controlling virtual agents in real-time simulations. The necessary data (e.g., position, speed) is acquired during the demonstration and later generalized using machine learning techniques [13].\n\n8. Spreadsheet Operations: Users can demonstrate data manipulation tasks in spreadsheets, which are then used to synthesize programs for automating similar operations [93].\n\n9. Step-by-Step Demonstrations: Some systems, like DiLogics, allow users to demonstrate individual steps of a task, mapping UI actions to step descriptions. This approach enables the construction of a catalog of step-to-UI action mappings for more complex automations [121].\n\n10. Skill-based Demonstrations: In reinforcement learning contexts, demonstrations can be used to learn reusable skills from offline datasets. These skills can then be leveraged to efficiently learn new tasks when given a set of demonstrations [75].\n\n11. Multi-modal Demonstrations: Some systems combine multiple types of demonstrations, such as natural language descriptions and video demonstrations, to generate more robust and versatile automation programs [35, 114].\n\nThese diverse types of user demonstrations enable both expert and non-expert users to teach machines a wide range of automation tasks across various domains, from web automation to robotics and data manipulation.\n\nConversion of Demonstrations to Executable Programs\nTLDR: The process of converting user demonstrations into executable programs involves various techniques such as program synthesis, learning from demonstration (LfD), and language model-guided approaches. These methods enable non-expert users to create automated scripts and robot behaviors without extensive programming knowledge.\n\nThe conversion of user demonstrations into executable programs is a crucial step in automating tasks across various domains. This process typically involves techniques from programming by demonstration (PbD), learning from demonstration (LfD), and program synthesis  (4, Biggs et al., 2003)  (111, Wang et al., 2023).\n\nOne approach to this conversion is the use of large language models (LLMs). Practitioners can now provide prompts with instructions and demonstrations, which LLMs can use to generate desired outputs or executable code  (108, Zhao et al., 2023). This method bridges the gap between natural language descriptions and programmatic representations of tasks.\n\nIn robotics, LfD techniques are particularly prevalent. These methods allow the generation of task descriptions from multiple human-guided demonstrations, from which relevant information can be extracted (99, San-Miguel et al., 2022). Some systems go further by inducing controller programs from immersive demonstrations using techniques like sequential importance sampling and clustering to discover goals in the state space  (69, Ramamoorthy et al., 2020).\n\nA notable advancement in this field is the combination of LfD with program synthesis. For instance, some methods first learn a program sketch that captures the target program's control flow and then complete this sketch using an LLM-guided search procedure  (113, Patton et al., 2023). This approach allows for the creation of more complex and flexible automated behaviors.\n\nFor non-expert users, systems have been developed that can map motion capture of humans to scripts that can be directly applied to robots  (56, Berenz et al., 2019). Similarly, knowledge-driven approaches have been proposed to convert human demonstrations in virtual reality to executable robot programs by leveraging semantic task knowledge and knowledge-augmented perception  (124, Katic et al., 2023).\n\nThe process of converting demonstrations to programs often involves generalization to capture the user's intent. However, automatic generalization may not always accurately reflect this intent, highlighting the importance of user verification and debugging  (92, Hirzel, 2022). To address this, some systems infer human-readable descriptions of tasks from demonstrations, allowing users to verify and debug the system's interpretation  (37, Tremblay et al., 2018).\n\nIn the context of data manipulation and task automation, programming by example (PBE) techniques have been developed. These methods allow PBE developers to integrate features like \"intelligent task automation\" into their applications by modeling domain-specific data entities and user actions as relational tables  (122, Wu et al., 2023).\n\nIt's worth noting that there are two main approaches to program induction from demonstrations: implicit and explicit. Implicit methods aim to induce underlying programs to mimic demonstrated behaviors, while explicit methods synthesize programs that can be directly executed to perform tasks  (76, Trivedi et al., 2021). Both approaches contribute to the broader goal of enabling non-expert users to create automated behaviors through demonstration  (90, Iovino et al., 2022).\n\nReferences:\n1.

The system allows an operator to show a task to the robot in a non ambiguous setting.\n\n\n\nApplications and Benefits of Demonstration-Based Automation\nTLDR: Demonstration-based automation enables users to create complex, flexible, and context-aware automated tasks across various domains without extensive programming knowledge. This approach offers benefits such as intuitive task representation, improved generalization, and the ability to capture user intent more accurately.\n\nDemonstration-based automation has found applications in various domains, offering significant benefits in task automation and user interaction. One key advantage is the ability for users to create executable procedures through demonstrations and instructions, allowing for intuitive task organization and representation  (10, Haines et al., 2009). This approach enables non-expert users to define complex tasks by breaking them down into manageable steps, making automation more accessible.\n\nThe integration of Learning from Demonstrations with syntactic methods has further enhanced the flexibility and intuitiveness of task representations. This combination allows for automatic recognition and extraction of important task structures from human users, as well as the execution of actions  (16, Lee, 2013). Such an approach bridges the gap between user intent and machine execution, leading to more robust and adaptable automation systems.\n\nIn the realm of multi-step task automation, demonstration-based approaches have shown promise in generating natural language instructions as high-level representations of sub-tasks. This method, combined with policy learning, enables the automation of complex tasks, such as multi-step crafting in virtual environments  (59, Chen et al., 2020). By leveraging human-generated instructions and demonstrations, these systems can better understand and replicate intricate task sequences.\n\nRecent advancements in GUI-based Programming by Demonstration (PBD) agents have further expanded the capabilities of demonstration-based automation. These systems not only collect information about demonstrated actions but also record rich contextual information, such as screen contents and app responses. This comprehensive data collection allows for better inference of user intent and improved generalization of resulting programs  (64, Myers et al., 2020)  (72, Li, 2020). The ability to extract parameters and their possible values from GUIs during demonstrations enhances the flexibility and adaptability of automated tasks.\n\nDemonstration-based learning has also shown benefits when combined with planning techniques. This integration allows for the inference of planning cost functions from demonstration data and the learning of tool use from human demonstrations using pose-tracking  (43, Xie et al., 2019). Such approaches improve both video prediction models and sampling-based planning processes, leading to more efficient and accurate automation in complex environments.\n\nIn summary, demonstration-based automation offers a powerful and user-friendly approach to creating automated tasks across various domains. Its benefits include intuitive task representation, improved generalization, and the ability to capture user intent more accurately, making it a valuable tool for both expert and non-expert users in developing sophisticated automation solutions.\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "00bdd80debc8549198001289188c6bea", "answer_text": "Ontology-based approaches in text summarization\nTLDR: Ontology-based approaches in text summarization leverage semantic knowledge to enhance the quality and relevance of summaries. These methods map text to ontological concepts, use graph-based representations, and incorporate domain-specific knowledge to improve semantic comprehension and sentence importance determination.\n\nOntology-based approaches have emerged as a promising direction in text summarization, aiming to address the challenge of semantic comprehension in automatic summarization systems  (21, Plaza, 2010). These methods typically involve mapping the input text to concepts within an ontology and representing both the document and its sentences as graphs (15, Gerv\u00b4as et al., 2008)  (21, Plaza, 2010).\n\nOne notable approach is the VENCE method, which uses semantic relations from an ontology to improve the quality of abduced functions in the training set  (1, Tourigny et al., 2016). Similarly, the SKGSUM model leverages semantic knowledge graphs to generate coherent and informative summaries  (3, Zhao et al., 2021).\n\nResearchers have explored various ontologies for summarization tasks, including domain-specific ones like UMLS for biomedical literature (15, Gerv\u00b4as et al., 2008) and general-purpose resources like Wikipedia  (19, Kochut, 2009). The use of ontologies allows for the extraction of relevant concepts and relationships, which can be analyzed using graph-based importance measures to determine sentence significance  (19, Kochut, 2009).\n\nSome approaches combine ontology-based techniques with machine learning methods. For instance, Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been used in conjunction with ontological structures to classify sentences and improve summarization performance  (5, Arora, 2022). Another study proposes using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks along with ontology-based semantic alignment for question-answering summarization  (4, N et al., 2021).\n\nThe integration of ontological knowledge has been shown to enhance summarization performance by improving semantic representation of sentences and boosting overall quality  (42, Allahyari et al., 2017)  (49, Ahmad et al., 2018). This approach is particularly beneficial in domains where specific knowledge is crucial, such as biomedical literature or technical documents.\n\nRecent advancements include the development of fully automatic ontology construction methods for summarization  (28, Huang et al., 2011) and the use of ontologies for both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques  (50, Dave, 2018)  (62, Vasko et al., 2020). These approaches often involve Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Semantic Relation (SR) detection to extract concepts and relations guided by the ontology  (62, Vasko et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, ontology-based approaches in text summarization offer a promising avenue for improving the semantic understanding and relevance of generated summaries. By incorporating domain knowledge and semantic relationships, these methods can potentially overcome some of the limitations of traditional summarization techniques.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods range from traditional supervised learning to deep neural networks, often incorporating semantic analysis and hybrid approaches to improve summary quality.\n\nMachine learning techniques have become increasingly prominent in text summarization, offering powerful tools to automatically identify and extract salient information from documents. These approaches can be broadly categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid methods, each with its own strengths and applications.\n\nSupervised learning methods have shown considerable success in text summarization tasks. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been effectively used in conjunction with ontology-based features to classify sentences for summary extraction, demonstrating improved performance over baseline classifiers  (14, Hennig et al., 2008). Similarly, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) have been employed with ontological knowledge to enhance the semantics of training sets, resulting in efficient multi-document summarization  (48, Ladouceur et al., 2017).\n\nDeep learning techniques have gained significant traction in recent years, particularly for abstractive summarization. Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) neural models, often enhanced with semantic content generalization and word sense disambiguation, have shown promising results in generating coherent and informative summaries  (63, Kouris et al., 2021). Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks have also been utilized in hybrid approaches, combining the strengths of deep learning with fuzzy logic for feature extraction  (75, Chen et al., 2023).\n\nFuzzy logic has emerged as a valuable tool in text summarization, often used in combination with other machine learning techniques. Fuzzy genetic semantic methods, which integrate fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and semantic role labeling, have been proposed to improve summary quality  (26, Binwahlan et al., 2011). Fuzzy logic-based approaches have been recognized for their ability to handle uncertainties in input text better than traditional models  (61, Nayyar et al., 2020).\n\nSemantic analysis plays a crucial role in many machine learning-based summarization techniques. Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) has been employed to enhance the understanding of sentence structure and meaning  (64, Qjidaa et al., 2021). Word embeddings and semantic vectors have also been utilized to improve the representation of textual content in summarization models  (79, Chang et al., 2023).\n\nHybrid approaches that combine multiple techniques have shown promise in leveraging the strengths of different methods. For instance, the integration of deep learning with semantic data transformations has been proposed to enhance abstractive summarization  (54, Alexandridis et al., 2019). Another hybrid model combines Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) with fuzzy rule-based systems for feature extraction  (46, Narvekar et al., 2017).\n\nRecent advancements in machine learning for text summarization include the development of frameworks that integrate multiple NLP methods for semantic analysis and similarity measurement  (77, Tian et al., 2023). These approaches aim to capture the most semantically expressive content while leveraging the power of advanced NLP techniques.\n\nIn conclusion, machine learning techniques for text summarization offer a diverse range of approaches, from traditional supervised methods to advanced deep learning models. The integration of semantic analysis, fuzzy logic, and hybrid architectures continues to drive improvements in summary quality and relevance.\n\nReferences:\n1.

To utilize the power of NLP and at the same time present the most semantically expressive content, a summarizer is applied to find the sentences that represent the most important semantics though out the text.\n\n\n\nHybrid methods combining ontology and machine learning\nTLDR: Hybrid approaches leverage both ontology-based knowledge representation and machine learning techniques to enhance text summarization. These methods combine semantic understanding from ontologies with the data-driven capabilities of machine learning algorithms to improve content selection, semantic interpretation, and summary generation.\n\nHybrid methods that combine ontology and machine learning techniques have emerged as a promising approach to text summarization, offering the benefits of both semantic knowledge representation and data-driven analysis. These methods typically integrate ontological information into various stages of the summarization process, from preprocessing and feature extraction to summary generation.\n\nOne common approach is to use ontologies for semantic annotation and concept extraction, which can then be used as input features for machine learning models. For instance, Liu et al. propose a method that uses fuzzy ontology to model literature context and extract relevant information, which is then combined with topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)  (2, Liu et al., 2020). Similarly, Giovannetti et al. describe a process where ontological information guides the recognition of semantically relevant terms in product descriptions, which can be used to improve semantic annotation  (16, Giovannetti et al., 2008).\n\nAnother approach involves using ontologies to enhance the semantic representation of text for machine learning models. Wang et al. present a novel ontology construction approach based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Knowledge Representation techniques to facilitate finding important sentences for automatic summarization  (13, Wang et al., 2007). This method aims to be more flexible and less domain-dependent than traditional statistical-based ontology construction methods.\n\nSome researchers have explored the integration of ontologies with specific machine learning algorithms. RAFIEI et al. propose a model that combines ontology-based concept extraction with K-means clustering to group sentences with similar meanings  (6, RAFIEI et al., 0). Shah et al. introduce a multi-document summarizer that incorporates an ontology-based entity recognition and disambiguation step into the summarization process  (7, Shah et al., 0).\n\nIn the domain of abstractive summarization, several hybrid approaches have been developed. MacAvaney et al. propose a sequence-to-sequence model augmented with domain-specific ontological information to enhance content selection and summary generation  (53, MacAvaney et al., 2019). Zhao et al. introduce an Augmented Abstractive Text Summarization Model with Semantic Understanding Graphs (SUMSUG), which uses dual encoders\u2014a text encoder and a graph encoder\u2014to guide summary generation  (73, Zhao et al., 2022).\n\nThe integration of knowledge graphs with graph neural networks has also shown promise in entity-guided text summarization. Chen proposes a framework that connects Knowledge Graphs and Graph Neural Networks to leverage knowledge beyond text and cross-sentence relations for creating faithful summaries  (78, Chen, 2023).\n\nHybrid methods have been applied in various domains, including medical coding  (23, Waraporn et al., 2010) and ontology learning from unstructured text (80, Vargas-Solar et al., 2023). These approaches often face challenges related to the ambiguity and complexity of natural language, but they offer the potential to improve summarization quality by combining the strengths of both ontology-based and machine learning techniques.\n\nIn conclusion, hybrid methods that combine ontology and machine learning for text summarization offer a powerful approach to addressing the limitations of individual techniques. By leveraging semantic knowledge from ontologies and the data-driven capabilities of machine learning algorithms, these methods can potentially improve content selection, semantic interpretation, and summary generation across various domains and summarization tasks.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This integration improves semantic representation, content selection, and generalization capabilities, leading to more accurate and informative summaries.\n\n1. Enhanced semantic representation: Hybrid approaches improve the semantic representation of sentences by incorporating ontological features, which is beneficial for selecting the most relevant sentences for summaries  (42, Allahyari et al., 2017). This enhanced representation can lead to more accurate and semantically rich summaries.\n\n2. Improved content selection: By combining ontology-based knowledge with machine learning techniques, hybrid methods can better identify and extract the most important information from texts. This is particularly useful in entity-guided summarization and multi-document summarization tasks  (68, Sharma et al., 2022).\n\n3. Semantic generalization: Hybrid approaches enable semantic-based text generalization, which can be used in conjunction with deep learning architectures to produce summaries in a more generalized form  (54, Alexandridis et al., 2019). This generalization capability can lead to more abstractive and concise summaries.\n\n4. Word sense disambiguation: Knowledge-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) can be integrated into hybrid frameworks to enhance the performance of sequence-to-sequence neural-based text summarization models  (63, Kouris et al., 2021). This integration helps in better understanding the context and meaning of words in the input text.\n\n5. Flexibility and domain adaptation: Hybrid methods can leverage wide-coverage ontologies to provide flexible semantic representations of sentence information content, improving summarization quality across different domains  (68, Sharma et al., 2022).\n\n6. Integration of multiple NLP techniques: Hybrid approaches allow for the integration of various NLP methods for semantic analysis and similarity measurement, enabling the extraction of the most semantically expressive content from texts  (77, Tian et al., 2023).\n\n7. Handling of uncertainty: Some hybrid methods incorporate fuzzy logic with machine learning techniques, allowing for better handling of uncertainties in input text compared to traditional models  (75, Chen et al., 2023).\n\n8.

{"case_id": "dda770e4b5c6b0933de17c4ba3aa3a39", "answer_text": "Types of Data Link Layer Problems\nTLDR: Data link layer problems encompass various issues that can disrupt network communication. These include link failures, data corruption, packet dropouts, and congestion, which can lead to connection termination or degraded performance.\n\n- Link Failures: Communication links between nodes can experience permanent or transient failures, rendering them unavailable for data transmission  (9, Ivanov et al., 2009). These failures can be spontaneous, with links going down or coming back up at any time  (20, Bunn et al., 2013).\n\n- Data Corruption: Random channel errors or malicious jamming attacks can cause data corruption on communication links  (26, Cetinkaya et al., 2017). This can lead to issues such as flit corruption in network-on-chip systems  (46, Venkatesha et al., 2022).\n\n- Packet Dropouts: Along with data corruption, packet dropouts on communication links can significantly impact network reliability  (26, Cetinkaya et al., 2017).\n\n- Congestion: Network overload can cause transient congestion, resulting in increased packet latencies  (9, Ivanov et al., 2009).\n\n- Timing Issues: Asynchronous transmission times across links can vary, potentially causing timing jitter  (20, Bunn et al., 2013)  (46, Venkatesha et al., 2022).\n\n- Faulty Transceivers: Omission faults can be caused by faulty transceivers, leading to network failures  (32, Swain et al., 2019).\n\n- Functional Faults: Other functional issues include misrouting, packet truncation, packet drops, and header/data flit loss  (46, Venkatesha et al., 2022).\n\n- Widespread Link Faults: When a significant proportion of network links become faulty, it can interrupt communication or cause data transmission failure  (52, Pan et al., 2023).\n\nIt's important to note that temporary faults in links are the most common type of fault affecting communication networks  (44, Barranco et al., 2021), highlighting the need for robust fault-tolerant systems in network design.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(9, Ivanov et al., 2009) | n_citations: 3 | Dependable wireless mesh networks: An integrated approach ]: \nWe propose a fault model covering the following lower layer failures: (a) link failure (permanent or transient), when a communication link between two nodes is not available any more...

Detection and recovery mechanisms are crucial for maintaining network connectivity and performance.\n\nData link layer problems can lead to connection termination through several mechanisms:\n\n1. Link Failures: Physical disconnections or poor channel quality can cause link failures, resulting in packet drops and potential connection termination. For instance, in wireless networks, nodes may change access points due to poor channel quality, leading to temporary disconnections  (29, Srinivasan et al., 2018). In such cases, all packets sent through the disconnected link are dropped until an alternate path is found, increasing packet loss.\n\n2. Consecutive Transmission Failures: Some protocols, like those used in ad hoc networks, implement a threshold for consecutive failed transmission attempts. For example, after eight consecutive failures (one attempt and seven retries), the link layer may send a failure notification to the network layer  (13, Ashraf, 2010). These failures can be caused by various factors, including interference or noise, and may be transient.\n\n3. MAC Layer Feedback: Protocols such as AOMDV utilize link layer feedback from IEEE 802.11 to detect link failures. When a node detects a link break, it broadcasts route error (RERR) packets to its neighbors  (11, Mrs.Sujata et al., 2010). This mechanism helps in quickly identifying and responding to link failures in mobile ad hoc networks.\n\n4. Misinterpretation of Congestion: Some routing protocols, like AODV, may misinterpret link failures at the MAC layer as broken links, even when the issue is caused by congestion at the receiver  (22, Moussa et al., 2013). This can lead to unnecessary connection terminations or rerouting.\n\n5. Packet Dropping and Triggering: When a node cannot reach its neighbor, it may drop the packet and trigger a link failure notification. In AODV, for example, when the MAC layer reports a link failure, the protocol drops the packets that were to be routed on the failed link  (14, Bhatia et al., 2010).\n\n6. TCP Component Crashes: In some cases, data link layer faults can cause crashes in the TCP component, resulting in the abrupt termination of all open TCP connections and loss of TCP state  (25, Hruby et al., 2016).\n\n7. Flow Control Issues: Bit errors in flow control frames can lead to permanent stoppage of data transmission on a link. For instance, an error in a flow control resume frame may cause the link to stop transmitting data indefinitely  (42, Shen et al., 2021).\n\nTo mitigate these issues, quick detection of link failure signals and rapid switching to alternate paths are crucial for link failure recovery  (41, Zhao et al., 2021). Additionally, in software-defined networking environments, connection termination may result in the removal of mappings from virtual switch tables  (28, Arzani et al., 2018).\n\nUnderstanding these mechanisms is essential for developing robust network protocols and implementing effective fault-tolerance strategies to maintain network connectivity and performance in the face of data link layer problems.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(29, Srinivasan et al., 2018) | n_citations: 42 | Machine Learning-Based Link Fault Identification and Localization in Complex Networks ]: \nSuch link faults may lead to: (i) a link disconnection without an immediate replacement, e.g., link cut and switch ports down, or (ii) a link reconnection, e.g., a wireless node changes its access point due to poor wireless channel quality... Upon a link disconnection, all the packets sent through the disconnected link are dropped before an alternate path is found, thus leading to increased packet loss.\n\n2. [(13, Ashraf, 2010) | n_citations: 5 | Quality of service and routing in wireless mesh networks ]: \nIf there are eight consecutive (one try and seven retries) failed transmission attempts to the next-hop node, then the link layer sends a failure notification to the network layer... The transmission failures may have been caused by a number of factors e.g. interference or noise and more importantly, transmission failures may be a transient phenomenon\n\n3.

These issues can lead to connectivity interruptions, reduced network stability, and challenges in maintaining reliable communication paths.\n\nData link layer problems have profound impacts on network performance, often manifesting in various ways:\n\n1. Reduced Server Reachability: In data center networks (DCNs), link failures can progressively decrease server reachability over time. As more network elements fail, the number of connected servers and the connectivity between them are expected to decline  (1, Couto et al., 0).\n\n2. Increased Packet Loss: Low-power and lossy networks, such as those using the RPL protocol, are particularly susceptible to packet loss due to network disruptions, including congestion and link failures  (30, Suhail et al., 2018). In large warehouse-scale datacenters, packet loss due to link corruption is a major problem, impacting overall network reliability  (49, Song et al., 2023).\n\n3. Connectivity Interruptions: Even in software-defined networks (SDNs), packets encountering failed links may be dropped for extended periods until failure notification and consistent update installation are completed  (34, Subramanian et al., 2019). The number of link failures that failover routing tables can tolerate before connectivity is interrupted (e.g., packets trapped in forwarding loops or hitting dead ends) is a critical consideration  (23, Panda et al., 2014).\n\n4. Throughput Degradation: In wireless networks, frequent beam switches and severe beam misalignment can cause link interruptions and non-negligible latency for link reconstruction, severely degrading communication quality, including coverage probability and throughput  (47, Chen et al., 2022).\n\n5. Network Instability: Link failures in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) can lead to route instability, necessitating frequent link re-establishments and potentially causing extended periods of disconnection  (15, Fard et al., 2011)  (38, Pitchai et al., 2020).\n\n6. Bottleneck Formation: In weakly-connected networks resulting from node failures and poor links, certain connections may become bottleneck links, further constraining network performance  (8, Doyle et al., 2008).\n\n7. Congestion and Cascading Failures: Data center networks can experience a variety of concurrent failures, ranging from failed or lossy links to localized, persistent congestion. These issues can compound, with one failure (e.g., a fiber cut) potentially leading to congestion-induced packet drops in other parts of the network  (50, Namyar et al., 2023).\n\nDespite these challenges, it's important to note that in dynamic communication networks where links may repeatedly fail and recover, reliable communication is still possible as long as there is no permanent cut between sender and receiver  (3, Shavit et al., 1989). However, maintaining this reliability often requires sophisticated detection and mitigation strategies.\n\nTo address these performance impacts, network designers and operators must implement robust failure detection mechanisms. For instance, if the number of packet losses on a link exceeds a certain threshold within a given time, it can be determined that the link has failed  (48, Guizani et al., 2023). Additionally, approaches like disabling corrupting links, while sometimes necessary, must be balanced against capacity constraints to maintain overall network performance  (49, Song et al., 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, data link layer problems can significantly impact network performance across various metrics, from basic connectivity to throughput and reliability. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach that considers the specific network architecture, failure modes, and performance requirements.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Anomaly detection in process mining aims to identify deviations from expected process behavior, with various techniques developed for offline and real-time analysis.\n\nProcess mining is a set of techniques that analyze event logs to extract knowledge about business processes, aiming to improve productivity and reduce costs  (10, Moreira, 2015)  (66, Zhong et al., 2022). Within this field, anomaly detection, also known as deviance mining, focuses on identifying and explaining why processes deviate from their normal or expected execution  (13, Nguyen et al., 2016)  (39, Elkhawaga et al., 2020).\n\nThe main approaches for anomaly detection in process mining can be broadly categorized into several groups: classification-based, rule mining-based, clustering-based, process mining-specific techniques, and statistical methods (17, Rinderle-Ma et al., 2017). These techniques can be applied to various aspects of process mining, including process discovery, where models are automatically generated from event logs, and conformance checking, which identifies discrepancies between process execution data and normative models  (36, Pegoraro et al., 2020).\n\nWhile many existing techniques focus on detecting anomalous cases in offline settings, there is a growing need for real-time, event-level anomaly detection to enable timely identification and response to potential issues  (67, Lu et al., 2022). Additionally, context-aware anomaly detection and performance anomaly investigation are emerging areas of research within the field  (72, Aalst et al., 2022).\n\nAs the field of process mining continues to evolve, new methods are being developed to address specific challenges, such as identifying highly frequent anomalous patterns in partially ordered process traces  (36, Pegoraro et al., 2020) and detecting business process drifts over time  (39, Elkhawaga et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:\n1.

A subgroup of these methods known as deviance mining approaches investigate performance anomalies.\n\n\n\nProcess discovery-based approaches\nTLDR: Process discovery-based approaches use mining algorithms to generate process models from event logs and then identify anomalies by comparing observed behavior to these models. These methods often integrate anomaly detection directly into the discovery process, allowing for simultaneous model creation and outlier identification.\n\nProcess discovery-based approaches form a significant category of anomaly detection techniques in process mining. These methods leverage process mining algorithms to automatically generate process models from event logs and then use these models as a basis for identifying anomalous behavior  (19, Luettgen et al., 2018). The core idea is to compare the discovered process model, which represents the typical or expected behavior, against individual process instances or traces to detect deviations.\n\nEarly work in this area focused primarily on discovering process models, but recent advancements have extended process discovery algorithms to handle outliers and anomalies concurrently with model generation  (20, Sani et al., 2018). This integration allows for more robust model discovery that can account for noise and exceptional cases in the data.\n\nSeveral notable algorithms and techniques have been developed within this approach. Van der Aalst and de Medeiros introduced two anomaly detection methods based on the \u03b1-algorithm, a fundamental process discovery technique  (49, Ebrahim et al., 2021). Building on this work, Bezerra et al. proposed a method that utilizes process mining techniques available in the ProM framework to detect anomalous traces  (6, Shukur et al., 2014)  (49, Ebrahim et al., 2021).\n\nMore recent process discovery algorithms, such as the Inductive Miner, have incorporated built-in filtering mechanisms to deal with certain types of outliers during the discovery process  (55, Kaczmarek et al., 2021). These integrated approaches aim to automatically detect and purge infrequent behaviors or anomalous traces, often referred to as noise and outliers, respectively, as part of the discovery task  (51, Pontieri et al., 2021).\n\nIt's important to note that while these process discovery-based approaches are effective at identifying anomalous executions within a process, they are generally not designed to pinpoint the root cause of failures or anomalies (4, Sep\u00falveda et al., 2013). As such, they are often used in conjunction with other techniques to provide a more comprehensive analysis of process anomalies.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods include popular algorithms like Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest (iForest), and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), which can detect outliers without requiring labeled training data.\n\nClassification and clustering-based approaches form a significant category of anomaly detection techniques in process mining. These methods leverage machine learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns or behaviors in process data. Some of the most commonly used techniques include:\n\n1. Local Outlier Factor (LOF): A popular and effective density-based method that compares the local density of a point to the local densities of its neighbors  (27, Miao et al., 2019)  (71, Liangsiri et al., 2022).\n\n2. Isolation Forest (iForest): An ensemble-based algorithm that isolates anomalies by randomly partitioning the data space. It has shown superior performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity compared to other methods  (84, Putrada et al., 2023).\n\n3. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): A classical classification-based method that identifies anomalies based on the distance to their nearest neighbors  (27, Miao et al., 2019).\n\n4. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs): A clustering-based unsupervised method particularly valuable for process monitoring, as it can detect anomalies and identify process phases without labeled training data  (82, Frey, 2023).\n\n5.

These techniques leverage the ability of autoencoders to learn compact representations of normal behavior  (44, Vasumathi et al., 2020).\n\n3. Data-driven approaches: These methods have gained popularity in anomaly detection due to their ability to learn from large datasets and adapt to complex patterns. They have demonstrated promising performance in various process mining scenarios  (43, Yang et al., 2020).\n\n4. Supervised and unsupervised models: These techniques provide efficient solutions for identifying known anomalies defined by given patterns or deviations from learned representations of normality. They can detect unusual amplitude values or spectral information within specific contexts  (45, Schockaert, 2020).\n\n5. Log-based anomaly detection: Recent approaches use historical logs to detect system anomalies using supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised methods. These techniques are particularly useful for analyzing process execution logs and identifying deviations from expected behavior  (93, Duan et al., 2023).\n\n6.

While some methods excel in specific scenarios, others offer more general applicability, with recent research focusing on comparative evaluations to guide practitioners in selecting appropriate techniques.\n\nComparative analysis of anomaly detection approaches in process mining reveals a diverse landscape of techniques, each with its own strengths and limitations. Traditional methods, such as distance-based, density-based, and dependency-based algorithms, continue to be widely used and serve as benchmarks for evaluating newer techniques  (80, Leeuwen et al., 2023). However, more advanced approaches have emerged to address specific challenges in process mining anomaly detection.\n\nLog-entry-level approaches like TIRESIAS and DeepLog have gained attention for their ability to detect anomalies at a granular level  (26, Meng et al., 2019). These methods are particularly useful for identifying fine-grained deviations in process execution. In contrast, frequency-based anomaly detection, which is inherent in some process discovery algorithms, offers a broader perspective on process behavior  (79, Caspary et al., 2023).\n\nRecent comparative studies have highlighted the performance of newer algorithms. For instance, a comparison of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Isolation Forest (iForest) found that iForest demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity in detecting anomalies  (84, Putrada et al., 2023). This suggests that ensemble-based methods like iForest may be particularly effective for certain types of process anomalies.\n\nThe integration of multiple perspectives in anomaly detection has also been a focus of recent research. While many approaches primarily consider control-flow information, techniques like BINet incorporate additional aspects through deep learning-based anomaly detection  (79, Caspary et al., 2023). This multi-dimensional approach can provide a more comprehensive view of process anomalies.\n\nIn the realm of business process logs, various algorithms have been proposed and compared. Bezerra et al. introduced threshold, iterative, and sampling algorithms for detecting anomalies in process-aware systems  (9, Sureka, 2015). Additionally, kernel-based sequential data anomaly detection techniques have shown promise in identifying outliers in business process event logs  (9, Sureka, 2015).\n\nA notable advancement in the field is the introduction of process mining techniques to build workflow models for anomaly detection. The MADDC approach, for example, uses process mining to construct workflow models and perform alignment-based diagnosis, facilitating a more consistent and accurate anomaly detection process  (64, Yang et al., 2022). This integration of process mining with anomaly detection showcases the potential for more context-aware and interpretable results.\n\nAs the field continues to evolve, comparative analyses of these diverse approaches provide valuable insights for practitioners and researchers alike. The choice of method often depends on the specific requirements of the process mining task, the nature of the available data, and the desired balance between detection accuracy and interpretability (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "e2491bb6e4147c18762e7fb25d0bf1fd", "answer_text": "PPS Signal Generation in GNSS Receivers\nTLDR: PPS signals in GNSS receivers are typically generated using a combination of hardware and software components. The process involves precise timing mechanisms and corrections based on satellite data to produce an accurate one-pulse-per-second output.\n\n(LLM MEMORY, 2024) The generation of Pulse-per-Second (PPS) signals in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers is a complex process that involves both hardware and software components. While the specific implementation can vary between different receiver models and manufacturers, the general principle remains consistent.\n\nTypically, GNSS receivers use a combination of a stable local oscillator and sophisticated timing algorithms to generate the PPS signal. The local oscillator, which is often a temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) or an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO), provides a stable frequency reference. However, this oscillator alone is not sufficient to generate an accurate PPS signal aligned with GNSS time.\n\nTo achieve the required accuracy, the receiver's software continuously processes the incoming satellite signals to estimate the receiver's position, velocity, and time (PVT). This PVT solution includes an estimate of the receiver's clock bias relative to GNSS time. The software uses this clock bias information to adjust the timing of the PPS signal output.\n\n(LLM MEMORY, 2024) While a digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO) or a numerically-controlled oscillator (NCO) could potentially be used in this process, it's important to note that the exact implementation can vary. Some receivers might use a DCO/NCO to fine-tune the timing, while others might use different methods to adjust the PPS output based on the calculated clock bias.\n\nThe PPS signal is typically generated by a dedicated hardware circuit that is controlled by the receiver's main processor. This circuit takes into account the clock bias corrections and other timing adjustments to ensure that the rising edge of the PPS signal aligns as closely as possible with the start of each UTC second.\n\nIt's worth noting that the accuracy of the PPS signal can vary depending on the quality of the receiver, the number and geometry of visible satellites, and environmental factors. High-end GNSS receivers can achieve PPS accuracies in the nanosecond range, while consumer-grade devices might have accuracies in the microsecond range.\n\nIn summary, while a digitally-controlled oscillator could be part of the PPS generation process in some GNSS receivers, the overall mechanism typically involves a combination of stable oscillators, timing circuits, and software-based corrections derived from the PVT solution.\n\nRole of Digitally-Controlled Oscillators in PPS\nTLDR: Digitally-controlled oscillators (DCOs) play a potential role in fine-tuning PPS signals in GNSS receivers, but their specific use varies among different implementations. While DCOs offer precise frequency control, the exact mechanisms for PPS generation in GNSS receivers can involve various approaches beyond just DCOs.\n\n(LLM MEMORY, 2024) Digitally-controlled oscillators (DCOs) can play a role in generating and fine-tuning Pulse-per-Second (PPS) signals in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, though their specific implementation and importance can vary among different receiver designs. DCOs offer the advantage of precise digital control over frequency output, which can be valuable for adjusting the timing of PPS signals based on computed clock bias.\n\nIn some GNSS receiver architectures, a DCO might be used to generate a high-frequency clock signal that is then divided down to produce the 1 Hz PPS output. The digital control allows for fine adjustments to the oscillator frequency, potentially enabling more precise alignment of the PPS signal with the start of each UTC second. However, it's important to note that not all GNSS receivers necessarily use DCOs for PPS generation.\n\n(LLM MEMORY, 2024) Alternative approaches may involve using a stable crystal oscillator as the primary time base, with digital logic circuits handling the final timing adjustments for the PPS output. Some receivers might employ a combination of analog oscillators and digital phase-locked loops (PLLs) to achieve the required timing accuracy.\n\nThe choice between using a DCO or other methods for PPS generation often depends on factors such as the desired accuracy, power consumption, cost, and overall receiver architecture. High-end GNSS receivers aimed at timing applications might be more likely to incorporate sophisticated oscillator control mechanisms, potentially including DCOs, to achieve nanosecond-level PPS accuracy.\n\nUltimately, while DCOs can be a valuable tool in PPS signal generation for GNSS receivers, they are just one potential component in a complex system that integrates hardware timing circuits with software-based corrections derived from satellite measurements and PVT (Position, Velocity, Time) calculations.\n\nClock Bias Estimation and PVT Algorithms\nTLDR: Clock bias estimation is a crucial component of GNSS receiver operations, integrated within Position, Velocity, and Time (PVT) algorithms. These algorithms use sophisticated techniques to calculate and compensate for clock errors, ensuring accurate timing and positioning.\n\n(LLM MEMORY, 2024) Clock bias estimation and PVT (Position, Velocity, Time) algorithms are fundamental to the operation of GNSS receivers, including the generation of accurate PPS signals. These algorithms work in tandem to process satellite signals and compute the receiver's position, velocity, and precise time.\n\nThe PVT algorithm typically uses measurements from multiple satellites to solve for four unknowns: the three-dimensional position of the receiver and the receiver's clock bias relative to GNSS time. This process, often based on least-squares estimation or Kalman filtering techniques, simultaneously determines the receiver's location and its time offset from the GNSS system time.\n\n(LLM MEMORY, 2024) The clock bias estimation is particularly crucial for timing applications, including the generation of PPS signals. As GNSS satellites carry highly accurate atomic clocks, the time information they broadcast serves as a reference. The receiver's local clock, typically less stable, accumulates errors over time. The PVT algorithm continuously estimates this clock bias, allowing the receiver to align its time scale with GNSS time.\n\nOnce the clock bias is estimated, this information can be used to adjust the timing of the PPS output. The receiver's software can apply corrections to the hardware timing circuits, ensuring that the rising edge of the PPS signal aligns as closely as possible with the start of each UTC second, despite the inherent instabilities in the receiver's local oscillator.\n\n(LLM MEMORY, 2024) It's worth noting that the accuracy of clock bias estimation, and consequently the PPS signal, depends on various factors such as the number and geometry of visible satellites, signal quality, and the sophistication of the receiver's algorithms. High-end GNSS receivers often employ advanced techniques like carrier-phase measurements and multi-constellation processing to further improve timing accuracy.\n\nIn summary, while the PPS signal may be physically generated by hardware components like oscillators or line drivers, its precise timing is fundamentally dependent on the continuous clock bias estimations provided by the receiver's PVT algorithms. This software-hardware interaction allows GNSS receivers to provide highly accurate timing outputs despite using relatively inexpensive local oscillators.\n\nPPS Signal Characteristics and Applications\nTLDR: PPS signals from GNSS receivers offer precise timing references with wide-ranging applications. These signals are characterized by their accuracy, stability, and universality, making them valuable for various scientific, industrial, and telecommunications purposes.\n\n(LLM MEMORY, 2024)\n\n\u2022 Accuracy: PPS signals typically provide timing accuracy in the range of nanoseconds to microseconds, depending on the quality of the GNSS receiver and environmental conditions.\n\n\u2022 Stability: Over short time intervals, PPS signals can exhibit excellent stability, often surpassing that of many local oscillators.\n\n\u2022 Universal Time Reference: PPS signals are synchronized to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), providing a globally consistent time reference.\n\n\u2022 Low Jitter: High-quality GNSS receivers produce PPS signals with very low jitter, making them suitable for precision timing applications.\n\n\u2022 Wide Availability: PPS outputs are common features in many GNSS receivers, from consumer-grade devices to professional timing instruments.\n\nApplications of PPS signals include:\n\n1. Telecommunications: Synchronizing cellular base stations and network equipment.\n\n2. Power Grid Management: Coordinating operations across wide-area electrical grids.\n\n3. Financial Trading: Providing accurate timestamps for high-frequency trading systems.\n\n4. Scientific Research: Supporting precise timing in experiments, particularly in physics and astronomy.\n\n5.

{"case_id": "5079291508735025cf2643c7a59d0293", "answer_text": "Popular approaches for mapping RSSI to distance\nTLDR: Popular approaches for mapping RSSI to distance include using path loss models, filtering techniques, and curve fitting. These methods aim to establish a relationship between RSSI values and physical distance, often incorporating environmental factors and signal propagation characteristics.\n\nSeveral approaches have been developed to map Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values to distance in Bluetooth-based positioning systems. One of the most common methods is the use of path loss models, which describe how signal strength decreases as distance increases  (45, Leung et al., 2017)  (88, Nguyen et al., 2020). The Log-Distance Path Loss (LDPL) model is frequently employed, relating RSSI to distance using parameters that account for environmental factors  (64, Dao et al., 2018)  (91, Mackey et al., 2020).\n\nTo improve accuracy, many approaches incorporate filtering techniques. For instance, Huang et al. propose using a median filter to process RSSI values before converting them to distances, followed by Kalman filtering to further reduce noise  (2, Huang et al., 2017). Similarly, Hager et al. suggest using a moving average filter to obtain a mean RSSI value before distance estimation  (173, Hager et al., 2023).\n\nAnother popular approach involves curve fitting and interpolation. AlBaghdadi et al. describe using MATLAB's curve fitting function to derive a distance equation based on multiple RSSI readings taken at different known distances  (81, AlBaghdadi et al., 2019). This method can help create a more accurate mapping specific to the deployment environment.\n\nSome researchers have explored more sophisticated techniques. Wu et al. mention using triangulation, least squares, fingerprinting, and maximum likelihood estimation for BLE-based RSSI positioning  (165, Wu et al., 2023). These methods can potentially offer improved accuracy in complex environments.\n\nIt's worth noting that while these approaches aim to improve distance estimation, the relationship between RSSI and distance is not always straightforward. Factors such as signal propagation characteristics, environmental conditions, and device variations can affect the accuracy of these methods (LLM MEMORY, 2024). Therefore, many implementations combine multiple techniques or incorporate additional sensor data to enhance positioning accuracy.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These limitations can lead to substantial inaccuracies in distance measurements, making it difficult to rely solely on RSSI for precise proximity detection.\n\nWhile RSSI-based distance estimation is a popular approach for Bluetooth-enabled devices, it comes with several inherent challenges and limitations. One of the primary issues is the non-trivial nature of translating RSSI values to accurate distance measurements. This difficulty arises from numerous factors that can influence RSSI readings, including phone hardware, drivers, operating systems, and environmental interference  (103, Kiran et al., 2020). \n\nThe relationship between RSSI and distance is further complicated by the noisy nature of RSSI as an indicator. Mukande et al. note that while RSSI values are strongly correlated with distance, they are dependent on many other factors, making precise estimation challenging  (157, Mukande et al., 2022). This noise in RSSI measurements can lead to significant errors in distance estimation. For instance, Gentner et al. highlight that an attenuation of 15 dB due to multipath propagation can result in distance estimation errors of tens of meters  (101, Gentner et al., 2020).\n\nReal-world conditions further exacerbate these challenges. Nicholls et al. point out that RSSI values can be dramatically affected by factors such as where phones are carried, body positions, physical barriers, and multipath environments  (112, Nicholls et al., 2020). These environmental factors make it nearly impossible to compute accurate distance predictions using RSSI signals alone.\n\nThe logarithmic relationship between RSSI and distance adds another layer of complexity. Gunther et al. explain that a 20 dB change in RSSI corresponds to a factor of 10 in distance, illustrating the difficulty of achieving precise measurements  (120, Gunther et al., 2020). This sensitivity to small changes in RSSI can lead to large discrepancies in estimated distances.\n\nResearch has shown that different estimation models can yield varying results. Peterseil et al. compared linear and logarithmic pathloss models for BLE-based distance estimation, finding that the linear model provided better accuracy  (133, Peterseil et al., 2021). However, both models still face significant challenges in achieving reliable distance estimates.\n\nGiven these limitations, relying solely on RSSI for accurate distance estimation is problematic. Hu et al. confirm that RSSI alone does not produce reliable estimates of physical distance, aligning with findings from previous studies in indoor positioning and contact tracing applications  (114, Hu et al., 2020). This underscores the need for complementary techniques or additional sensor data to enhance the accuracy of proximity detection in Bluetooth-based systems.\n\nReferences:\n1.

RSSI alone does not produce reliable estimates of physical distance, which aligns with the findings of previous studies in indoor positioning [26] and contact tracing [33].\n\n\n\nFactors affecting RSSI measurements\nTLDR: RSSI measurements are influenced by various environmental and device-related factors, making distance estimation challenging. These factors include radio frequency, transceiver variations, antenna orientation, node positioning, and physical obstacles.\n\nSeveral key factors can significantly affect RSSI measurements, impacting the accuracy of distance estimation between Bluetooth devices:\n\n1. Radio frequency: The specific frequency used for communication can influence RSSI values  (13, Karagiannis et al., 2012).\n\n2. Transceiver variations: Differences in the hardware of Bluetooth transceivers can lead to inconsistencies in RSSI measurements  (13, Karagiannis et al., 2012).\n\n3. Antenna orientation: The direction and positioning of device antennas can affect signal strength and, consequently, RSSI readings  (13, Karagiannis et al., 2012).\n\n4. Node positioning: The relative positions of Bluetooth devices, including their elevation, play a significant role in RSSI-based distance calculations  (13, Karagiannis et al., 2012).\n\n5. Environmental conditions: Physical obstacles, reflections, and other environmental factors can impact signal propagation and RSSI measurements (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\n6. Device proximity: The actual distance between devices directly affects RSSI values, with signal strength generally decreasing as distance increases  (25, Christidis et al., 2015).\n\n7. Measurement accuracy: The precision of RSSI readings can vary, affecting the reliability of distance estimations  (25, Christidis et al., 2015).\n\n8. Signal attenuation: As the distance between devices increases, RSSI values tend to decrease. For example, measurements have shown mean RSSI values of -65.5 dBm at 1m, -78.4 dBm at 5m, -84.1 dBm at 10m, and -90.8 dBm at 16m (151, Po\u0142ys et al., 2022).\n\nUnderstanding these factors is crucial for developing more accurate RSSI-based distance estimation algorithms and for interpreting the limitations of such approaches in real-world applications.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These approaches utilize various prompt engineering techniques, in-context learning, and task decomposition strategies to improve the accuracy and efficiency of SQL generation.\n\nRecent advancements in natural language processing have led to the development of specialized approaches for providing LLM assistance when people author SQL queries. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in generating SQL queries from natural language input, a task commonly referred to as Text-to-SQL  (17, Nakhost et al., 2023)  (244, Fan et al., 2024).\n\nOne of the primary challenges in LLM-based Text-to-SQL is designing effective prompt templates to enable LLMs to generate accurate SQL queries  (35, Yang et al., 2024). Researchers have explored various prompt engineering techniques to improve the performance of LLMs in this task. For instance, some approaches focus on retrieving similar SQL demonstrations that share question skeletons with the input question  (23, Tian et al., 2023), while others employ few-shot learning by including demonstration examples in the prompt  (22, Wen et al., 2023).\n\nSeveral innovative methods have been proposed to enhance LLM performance in Text-to-SQL tasks. The C3 method, which combines Clear Prompting, Calibration with Hints, and Consistent Output, has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Spider Challenge in zero-shot settings  (16, Chen et al., 2023). Another approach, SQLPrompt, improves few-shot prompting capabilities through innovative prompt design and execution-based consistency decoding strategies  (25, Arik et al., 2023).\n\nTask decomposition has also been explored as a strategy to improve Text-to-SQL performance. Some methods break down the task into multiple steps, such as SQL sketch generation followed by SQL query completion  (21, Gu et al., 2023). Others utilize chain-of-thought techniques to enhance the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs  (36, Zhuo et al., 2024).\n\nResearchers have also developed specialized models for generating SQL queries in specific dialects. For example, models fine-tuned on synthetic datasets tailored to Snowflake SQL and GoogleSQL dialects have demonstrated superior performance in zero-shot settings compared to baseline GPT-4 models  (32, Rebei, 2023).\n\nAs the field progresses, there is a growing focus on improving the efficiency and accuracy of LLM-based Text-to-SQL approaches. Techniques such as diverse exemplar sampling  (29, Arora et al., 2023) and execution-based self-consistent prompting  (168, Fu et al., 2023) have shown promising results in enhancing the performance of these systems.\n\nIn conclusion, LLM-based Text-to-SQL approaches represent a significant advancement in providing assistance for SQL query authoring. These methods leverage the power of large language models, combined with sophisticated prompt engineering and task decomposition strategies, to generate accurate SQL queries from natural language input. As research in this area continues to evolve, we can expect further improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of these specialized approaches.\n\nReferences:\n1.

SQL-PALM (Sun et al., 2023) proposes an LLM-based Text-to-SQL model, using the execution-based self-consistent prompting approach, and outperforms previous Text-2-SQL methods by a large margin.\n\n\n\nPrompt Engineering Techniques\nTLDR: Prompt engineering is crucial for improving LLM performance in Text-to-SQL tasks. Techniques include designing effective prompt templates, incorporating in-context examples, and using chain-of-thought approaches to enhance SQL generation accuracy.\n\nPrompt engineering has emerged as a critical component in developing specialized approaches for LLM assistance in SQL query authoring. Researchers have explored various techniques to design effective prompt templates that enable LLMs to generate accurate SQL queries  (35, Yang et al., 2024). These techniques aim to improve the performance of LLMs in Text-to-SQL tasks through innovative prompt designs and strategies.\n\nOne key approach is the use of in-context learning, where carefully selected examples are included in the prompt to guide the LLM's SQL generation. Several studies have investigated methods for retrieving and incorporating relevant SQL demonstrations that share similar question structures with the input query  (23, Tian et al., 2023)  (166, Gao et al., 2023). This approach has shown promise in improving the LLM's ability to generate valid and accurate SQL queries.\n\nResearchers have also developed techniques to create diverse and comprehensive prompt templates. For instance, the Generic Prompt (GP) algorithm samples a diverse set of exemplars that cover a wide range of SQL operators, clauses, and functions, as well as maximizing database coverage  (29, Arora et al., 2023). This approach eliminates the need for dynamic exemplar retrieval, resulting in a more efficient method.\n\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been identified as particularly suitable for the complex reasoning processes involved in Text-to-SQL tasks  (20, Zhang et al., 2023). This technique encourages LLMs to break down the SQL generation process into multiple steps, potentially improving the semantic understanding and accuracy of the generated queries.\n\nSome notable approaches have combined multiple prompt engineering techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance. For example, the C3 method, which incorporates Clear Prompting, Calibration with Hints, and Consistent Output, has shown significant improvements in zero-shot Text-to-SQL tasks  (16, Chen et al., 2023).\n\nResearchers have also explored ways to improve few-shot prompting capabilities. The SQLPrompt method introduces innovative prompt designs and execution-based consistency decoding strategies to enhance Text-to-SQL performance  (25, Arik et al., 2023). Additionally, techniques such as MixPrompt and MixLLMs have been proposed to diversify SQL proposals during consistency selection by using different prompt designs and foundation models.\n\nAs the field progresses, there is ongoing research into optimizing prompt representations for Text-to-SQL tasks. This includes incorporating natural language questions, table schemas, and additional instructions into the prompt structure  (240, Chen et al., 2024). Researchers are also exploring methods for selecting the most relevant examples to include in prompts, focusing on similarities between the target question and potential SQL queries  (241, NULL, 2024).\n\nIn conclusion, prompt engineering techniques play a crucial role in enhancing LLM performance for SQL query assistance. By leveraging in-context learning, diverse exemplar sampling, chain-of-thought prompting, and other innovative strategies, researchers continue to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Text-to-SQL systems.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These approaches improve SQL generation accuracy by leveraging LLMs' strengths in handling specific aspects of the query generation process.\n\nTask decomposition has emerged as a powerful strategy for improving LLM assistance in SQL query authoring. By breaking down the complex Text-to-SQL task into smaller, more manageable subtasks, researchers have developed approaches that can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of SQL generation.\n\nOne notable approach is the Divide-and-Prompt (DnP) paradigm, which divides the Text-to-SQL task into subtasks and tackles each using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting  (24, Tan et al., 2023). This method leverages the strengths of LLMs in handling specific aspects of the query generation process, resulting in improved performance.\n\nSeveral researchers have proposed multi-step frameworks for Text-to-SQL tasks. For instance, STEPS decomposes the task into smaller text-to-clause tasks, allowing users to validate and refine generated queries through editable explanations  (28, Li et al., 2023). Similarly, an elaborated Text-to-SQL framework has been proposed that breaks down the task into four components: query writing, explain-squeeze schema linking, SQL generation, and SQL boosting  (31, Ruan et al., 2023).\n\nSome approaches focus on specific aspects of the SQL generation process. For example, the CRUSH method leverages LLM hallucination in conjunction with dense retrieval to identify a high-recall subset of schema elements for downstream Text-to-SQL stages  (26, Kothyari et al., 2023). Another approach improves WHERE clause generation by leveraging column-cell relations and learning to replicate content from column names, cells, or SQL keywords  (3, Qin et al., 2018).\n\nResearchers have also explored iterative approaches to Text-to-SQL tasks. One method involves invoking-linearization-generation procedures that utilize LLMs for performing reasoning on specialized interfaces until deriving the final answer or executable SQL  (165, Zhou et al., 2023). Another approach introduces a goal-oriented dialogue model, DialSQL, which interacts with users to extract and correct potential errors in generated queries over multiple turns  (4, Gur et al., 2018).\n\nRecent advancements include the development of structure-to-SQL frameworks that leverage inherent structure information to improve SQL generation  (37, Huang et al., 2024), and the introduction of specialized tools designed for interaction with intricate databases to support LLMs in crafting complex SQL queries  (238, Shu et al., 2024).\n\nSome researchers have explored few-shot prompting methods that decompose the Text-to-SQL task into multiple steps, addressing limitations of previous zero-shot approaches  (14, Pourreza et al., 2023). Others have focused on enhancing the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs using chain-of-thought techniques  (36, Zhuo et al., 2024).\n\nAs the field continues to evolve, researchers are exploring automated knowledge generation for Text-to-SQL using LLMs, presenting complete Knowledge-to-SQL pipelines to enhance SQL generation capabilities  (242, Chen et al., 2024). These approaches demonstrate the ongoing efforts to improve LLM assistance in SQL query authoring through innovative task decomposition strategies.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These tools focus on improving query accuracy, handling complex databases, and optimizing LLM performance for specific SQL dialects.\n\nHere is a list of notable specialized tools and frameworks for LLM-assisted SQL query authoring:\n\n1. SUQL: This framework augments SQL with primitives for processing free text. It leverages LLMs' familiarity with SQL to create a semantic parser for translating user queries in a conversation into SUQL queries through in-context learning  (33, Tjangnaka et al., 2023).\n\n2. Dialect-Specific SQL Models: Researchers have introduced models specialized in generating SQL queries for specific dialects like Snowflake SQL and GoogleSQL. These fine-tuned models have demonstrated superior performance in zero-shot settings compared to baseline GPT-4 models  (32, Rebei, 2023).\n\n3. SQL-LLM Query System: This proposed system allows querying pre-trained LLMs with SQL scripts. It aims to preserve the main characteristics of SQL when executed over LLM data, enabling precision and complexity beyond the limitations of natural language prompts  (18, Saeed et al., 2023).\n\n4. NLP-Assisted SQL Query Formation: A system designed to assist users in forming complex SQL queries through natural language processing. It helps users understand complex SQL databases and generate queries for them  (13, Salvi et al., 2022).\n\n5. NLSQL: This tool allows the conversion of natural language to SQL queries using LLMs. It provides an intuitive interface for interacting with databases by translating natural language queries to SQL using models like OpenAI GPT 3.5  (34, Narechania et al., 2023).\n\n6. Chunked Schema Framework: This approach divides database schemas into chunks to fit more information into a limited context. It combines fine-tuned open-source models (Llama-2 and Code Llama) to focus on different tasks, leveraging each model's core competency to increase SQL query accuracy (247, Err'azuriz et al., 2024).\n\n7. METASQL: This framework optimizes LLM prompting for SQL query generation. It leverages the powerful generation capabilities of modern LLMs to produce high-quality SQL candidates, yielding superior outputs without specific fine-tuning over existing benchmarks  (248, Zhang et al., 2024).\n\nThese specialized tools and frameworks represent ongoing efforts to improve LLM assistance in SQL query authoring, addressing various challenges such as handling complex databases, optimizing performance for specific SQL dialects, and enhancing the accuracy of query generation.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Evaluations show significant improvements in accuracy, with some approaches achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.\n\nRecent advancements in LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems have led to substantial performance improvements and more robust evaluation methods. Researchers have explored various techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of SQL query generation, with several approaches demonstrating notable results on benchmark datasets.\n\nOne significant improvement comes from the development of specialized models for specific SQL dialects. Fine-tuned models for Snowflake SQL and GoogleSQL have shown superior performance in zero-shot settings compared to baseline GPT-4 models, with Code-Llama achieving accuracy rates of 81.58% for Snowflake SQL and 82.66% for GoogleSQL  (32, Rebei, 2023). This demonstrates the potential of dialect-specific fine-tuning to improve LLM performance in Text-to-SQL tasks.\n\nThe C3 method, which combines Clear Prompting, Calibration with Hints, and Consistent Output, has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Spider Challenge in zero-shot settings. This approach reached 82.3% execution accuracy on the holdout test set, providing a systematic treatment for zero-shot Text-to-SQL  (16, Chen et al., 2023).\n\nResearchers have also explored task decomposition strategies to improve performance. The ZeroNL2SQL method, for example, breaks down the Text-to-SQL task into SQL sketch generation by PLMs and SQL query completion by LLMs, addressing intrinsic challenges of zero-shot NL2SQL  (21, Gu et al., 2023). Similarly, a novel few-shot prompting method decomposes the task into multiple steps, addressing limitations of previous zero-shot approaches  (14, Pourreza et al., 2023).\n\nPrompt engineering techniques have played a crucial role in improving LLM performance. Few-shot prompts that include example (question, SQL) pairs have shown effectiveness in guiding LLMs to generate accurate SQL queries  (164, Chen et al., 2023). Additionally, the execution-based self-consistent prompting approach, as used in SQL-PALM, has demonstrated significant improvements over previous Text-to-SQL methods  (168, Fu et al., 2023).\n\nTo further enhance SQL generation capabilities, some researchers have leveraged pre-training corpora specifically tailored for SQL tasks. For instance, using the SQL segment from StarCoder's pre-training corpus has shown promise in improving LLM performance  (236, Li et al., 2024).\n\nEvaluation methods have also evolved, with researchers exploring various approaches to assess the performance of Text-to-SQL systems. Some studies have experimented with SQL generation approaches where LLMs generate SQL queries that are then executed on datasets to obtain answers, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the system's effectiveness  (246, Dasgupta et al., 2024).\n\nThese performance improvements and evaluation methods demonstrate the rapid progress in LLM-assisted SQL query authoring. As research continues, we can expect further advancements in accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to handle complex SQL queries across various dialects and database structures.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This approach allows for more comprehensive assessments of land use, resource allocation, and long-term environmental impacts.\n\nThe integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and economic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for improving environmental policy analysis and decision-making. This approach combines the spatial data-driven procedures of GIS with economic-ecological interaction models, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of complex environmental systems  (6, Pang et al., 2000). By linking spatial data with economic principles, policymakers can better assess the impacts of economic development on the environment and forecast future scenarios  (14, Grzegorz et al., 2007).\n\nOne of the key advantages of this integration is the ability to simulate and predict eco-environmental trends based on various socio-economic development plans. For instance, the combination of System Dynamics (SD) models with GIS components allows for dynamic simulations that reveal the relationships between socio-economic development and the eco-environment, providing crucial support for regional sustainable development decision-making  (9, Jie, 2003).\n\nIn the context of land-use planning, GIS-integrated models have become essential tools. These models can incorporate multiple objectives, such as maximizing food production, employment, and income while minimizing soil erosion  (11, Riveira et al., 2006). More advanced approaches, like agent-based simulations and cellular automata (CA) models, offer new horizons for urban economics by allowing observation of space-time-specific paths to global equilibrium  (8, Wu et al., 2001).\n\nThe integration extends to resource management as well. For example, in agricultural watersheds, spatial decision support systems (SDSS) have been developed that combine hydrological and crop growth models with economic analysis and resource allocation optimization techniques within a GIS framework  (12, Galgale, 2006). This integration enables more efficient and sustainable allocation of land and water resources for crop production.\n\nIn the realm of renewable energy, GIS-based analysis has been used to estimate supply costs and capacity factors, integrating data on administrative borders, population, GDP, land cover, topography, and protected areas  (45, Mattsson et al., 2020). This approach allows for more accurate assessments of renewable energy potential and its economic viability.\n\nThe integration of GIS and economic modeling also plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Integrated assessment models combine elements of physical, ecological, and socioeconomic systems to inform regional policy-making  (49, Zhang et al., 2020). For instance, the G4M model simulates forest management and land use changes to predict the impacts of policies on deforestation, forest growth, and emissions from the land use sector (36, \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430, 2017).\n\nAs environmental challenges become increasingly complex, the need for integrated multi-domain models spanning several spatiotemporal scales has grown. These models can inform decision-makers on the effectiveness of policies, particularly in addressing climate change through the built environment  (58, Reeves et al., 2022). By combining GIS spatial analysis techniques with economic modeling, policymakers can develop more accurate, effective, and sustainable environmental policies that account for both ecological and socio-economic factors.\n\nReferences:\n1.

To unlock the tremendous potential that the built environment offers to address climate change, integrated multi-domain models spanning several spatiotemporal scales can inform decision makers on the effectiveness of policies.\n\n\n\nEnhanced Decision-Making and Policy Planning\nTLDR: The integration of GIS and economic modeling significantly enhances environmental decision-making and policy planning. These tools provide policymakers with data-driven insights, allowing for more effective and sustainable environmental management strategies.\n\nThe combination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and economic modeling has revolutionized environmental decision-making and policy planning processes. GIS technology offers a more explicit and reasoned approach to environmental decision-making, although the development of decision support tools within GIS software has been relatively slow  (4, Jin et al., 1995). This integration allows policymakers to gain valuable insights into land-use changes, understand the drivers of land-cover transformation, and predict future economic and environmental influences  (37, Rijal et al., 2018).\n\nThe power of integrated modeling is exemplified in the exploration of economic impacts resulting from policy bundles aimed at achieving low-carbon transitions. These models simulate the economy, technology, and climate system with high-definition policy instruments, providing a comprehensive view of potential outcomes  (34, Mercure et al., 2017). Such integrated approaches can address multiple ecological concerns simultaneously, including climate change, biodiversity, desertification, and food security (13, Ponce-Hernandez, 2007).\n\nAdvanced modeling techniques, such as the integration of Artificial Neural Networks with Monte Carlo simulations and Cellular Automata (ANN-MC_CA), offer policymakers insights into complex phenomena like forest fragmentation. These tools aid in developing effective strategies to mitigate negative impacts of land-use change and promote sustainable practices  (60, Malheiros et al., 2023). Urban Computable General Equilibrium models, like the Multi-Objective Local Environmental Simulator (MOLES), help policymakers identify interventions that are economically efficient, environmentally effective, and balanced from fiscal and distributional perspectives  (53, Halkos et al., 2021).\n\nThe transformation of geospatial data into Linked Data using standards like OWL, PROV-O, and GeoSPARQL supports automated ontology-based policy decisions, implementing relevant geospatial relationships in policy evaluation  (54, Santos et al., 2021). This approach, combined with the increasing accessibility of environmental models and geospatial data through powerful computers and Internet-accessible assessment tools, is democratizing the use of these decision-support systems  (22, David et al., 2012).\n\nThese integrated systems can predict the effects of environmental policies that impose constraints on development, such as the protection of wetlands, floodplains, riparian buffers, steep slopes, or seismically unstable areas  (38, Waddell et al., 2018). The evolution of GIS has made analysis methods more practical and decision-making more intuitive, with systems becoming less expensive to implement, easier to learn, and more customizable  (25, Lanci, 2013).\n\nEnvironmental Decision Support Systems (EDSS) allow the use, management, and capture of specialized knowledge from a wide spectrum of natural sciences, effectively applying this knowledge to various environmental management and design tasks (10, S\u00e0nchez-Marr\u00e8 et al., 2003). These systems can assist in identifying environmental problems, building statistical models that use experts' knowledge, and planning effective management programs  (2, Nakamori et al., 1990).\n\nIn the context of climate policy, integrated methods can provide decision support for complex problems by incorporating climate models, economic impact assessments, and social welfare functions  (21, Goldstein et al., 2012). This holistic approach enables policymakers to make more informed decisions that balance environmental protection with economic and social considerations, ultimately leading to more effective and sustainable environmental policies.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This approach enables more accurate evaluation of ecological impacts, land use changes, and policy effectiveness across various scales.\n\nThe integration of spatial analysis techniques within Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has significantly advanced environmental assessment capabilities, providing powerful tools for policymakers and researchers. These techniques allow for the incorporation of complex spatial relationships and data structures, enabling more comprehensive and accurate evaluations of environmental impacts and policy effectiveness  (48, Saavedra et al., 2020).\n\nOne of the key advantages of spatial analysis in environmental assessment is its ability to integrate dynamic simulation models within GIS frameworks. This integration creates spatial decision support systems (SDSS) that can generate responses to theoretical \"What if?\" scenarios, allowing policymakers to explore potential outcomes of different environmental policies and interventions  (19, Sengupta, 2009). These systems are particularly valuable in watershed management, where they can help optimize resource allocation and assess the impacts of land use changes on water quality and quantity.\n\nThe application of GIS in environmental impact analysis (EIA) has become increasingly important, as it provides a platform for collecting, managing, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial and temporal information  (48, Saavedra et al., 2020). This capability is crucial for sustainable ecological and environmental planning, allowing for the identification of ecologically significant areas and potential rehabilitation sites  (27, Kumar et al., 2014).\n\nRecent advancements in spatial causal inference have further enhanced the rigor of environmental assessments. These methods address the challenges posed by complex correlation structures and spatial interference, enabling more accurate evaluations of policy impacts and environmental interventions  (44, Reich et al., 2020). This approach is particularly valuable in assessing the effectiveness of conservation policies and understanding the drivers of land-use and land-cover changes.\n\nThe integration of environmental assessment into land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) simulation models represents a growing trend in spatial analysis. These models can provide insights into the long-term impacts of land-use policies and help balance economic development with environmental protection  (55, Ferraro et al., 2021). By incorporating environmental factors into LUCC simulations, policymakers can make more informed decisions about land management and conservation strategies.\n\nGIS-based spatial analysis also offers innovative solutions for specific environmental challenges. For instance, the automation of cartogram building for ecological and economic land capacity assessment allows for more accurate consideration of soil conditions and terrain relief  (51, YANCHUK et al., 2020). This level of detail is crucial for developing targeted and effective environmental policies.\n\nIn urban planning and policy, spatial regression techniques can provide insights into local submarkets and city-wide trends, informing decisions on land release and density-based rezoning  (33, Sarkar et al., 2016). This granular approach to spatial analysis enables policymakers to tailor environmental and urban development strategies to specific local conditions, potentially leading to more effective and sustainable outcomes.\n\nBy leveraging these advanced spatial analysis techniques within GIS frameworks, policymakers and environmental managers can conduct more comprehensive and accurate environmental assessments. This integration of spatial data, dynamic modeling, and causal inference methods enhances the ability to predict, evaluate, and mitigate environmental impacts across various scales, ultimately leading to more informed and effective environmental policies.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This approach enables more precise policy formulation and implementation, leading to improved environmental and economic outcomes.\n\nThe combination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and economic modeling has significantly improved the accuracy and effectiveness of resource management strategies. This integration allows for more precise decision-making by incorporating spatial data, economic constraints, and environmental factors into a unified analytical framework.\n\nOne notable application of this integrated approach is in agricultural resource management. A GIS-based model for dairy manure transportation demonstrates how spatial analysis can optimize resource allocation while minimizing costs. This model incorporates land use types, farm locations, road networks, and distances to identify the most efficient transportation routes, balancing economic and environmental constraints  (47, Kamilaris et al., 2020). Such approaches can lead to more sustainable agricultural practices and reduced environmental impacts.\n\nThe integration of GIS technology with economic analysis also enables more accurate assessments of environmental efficiency. By calculating environmental efficiency using GIS, policymakers can measure economic development and implement targeted policies to constrain pollution discharge in specific regions. This approach allows for the refinement of economic development models to improve overall environmental efficiency  (52, Zhao, 2021).\n\nSpatial heterogeneity plays a crucial role in resource management and policy formulation. Research has shown that incorporating spatial dimensions and strategic behavior of decision-makers can significantly alter environmental policies compared to those developed without considering spatial factors or strategic interactions. The geographical configuration and behavior of neighboring regions influence a region's optimal environmental policies, affecting both emission levels and spatial allocation of resources  (41, Frutos et al., 2019).\n\nIdentifying spatial regimes through GIS and economic modeling can provide a more detailed understanding of production environments. This approach offers more accurate information to guide extension services and policymakers. By estimating spatial autoregressive models with autoregressive disturbances and regimes, researchers can capture both spatial spillover effects and heterogeneous impacts, leading to more nuanced and effective resource management strategies (30, Bill'e et al., 2016).\n\nThe integration of complex patterns determined by economic, geographical, institutional, and social factors with non-linear decision processes of agents has emerged as an important tool for modeling spatial inequalities over time  (26, Ausloos et al., 2014). This holistic approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of resource distribution and management challenges.\n\nFurthermore, spatial microsimulation analysis, which adds geographical information to microlevel data, enables small-area approaches in policy analysis. This technique provides an effective solution for analyzing spatial and socioeconomic impacts of alternative urban, regional, and national social policies. It allows for \"what-if\" scenario analyses, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of resource management strategies  (31, Panori et al., 2016).\n\nBy leveraging these integrated GIS and economic modeling approaches, policymakers and resource managers can develop more accurate, targeted, and effective strategies for managing environmental resources. This integration not only improves the precision of resource allocation but also enhances the ability to predict and mitigate potential environmental impacts, leading to more sustainable and economically viable resource management practices.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(30, Bill'e et al., 2016) | n_citations: 22 | Modelling spatial regimes in farms technologies ]: \nOverall, we find that when there is spatial heterogeneity the identification of spatial regimes can help drawing a more detailed picture of the production environment and provide more accurate information to guide extension services and policy makers... For this latter purpose, once the spatial regimes are identified, we estimate a spatial autoregressive model with autoregressive disturbances and regimes, which captures both the spatial spillover effects (true contagion) and the heterogeneous ones (apparent contagion).\n\n5. [(26, Ausloos et al., 2014) | n_citations: 17 | Spatial interactions in agent-based modeling ]: \nThe main body of (theory-based) economic research in this area relies on models that capture the spatial geographical structure in a very simple form...

This approach allows policymakers to visualize potential outcomes, optimize resource allocation, and align policies with sustainable development goals.\n\nThe integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and economic modeling has significantly improved the effectiveness of environmental policy implementation and evaluation. This approach provides policymakers with powerful tools to visualize, analyze, and predict the outcomes of various policy scenarios, particularly in urban planning and sustainable development contexts.\n\nA key advantage of this integration is the ability to develop and evaluate growth scenarios that align with sustainable and smart city goals. GIS and Cellular Automata (CA) based urban growth modeling have demonstrated their capacity to enhance existing urban growth practices by simulating different land use policies and their potential impacts  (39, Saxena et al., 2018). This approach allows planners to select appropriate land use policies that satisfy environmental objectives while promoting sustainable urban development.\n\nThe use of GIS and economic modeling in policy evaluation enables a more comprehensive assessment of policy impacts across various spatial and temporal scales. By incorporating spatial data and economic factors, policymakers can better understand the potential trade-offs between economic development and environmental protection (LLM MEMORY, 2024). This integrated approach facilitates the identification of optimal policy interventions that balance multiple objectives, such as economic growth, environmental conservation, and social equity.\n\nFurthermore, the integration of GIS and economic modeling supports adaptive management strategies in policy implementation. As environmental conditions and socio-economic factors change over time, these tools allow for real-time monitoring and adjustment of policies to ensure their continued effectiveness (LLM MEMORY, 2024). This dynamic approach to policy implementation and evaluation is particularly valuable in addressing complex environmental challenges that require flexible and responsive governance.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of GIS spatial analysis techniques with economic modeling significantly enhances the effectiveness of environmental policy implementation and evaluation. By providing a platform for scenario-based planning, impact assessment, and adaptive management, this approach enables policymakers to develop more targeted, efficient, and sustainable environmental policies.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This approach combines textual semantics with structural information from citation networks, leading to improved performance in various tasks related to scientific literature analysis.\n\nCitation graphs have become an integral component in improving neural language models for scientific papers  (3, Leskovec et al., 2022). By incorporating citation links, these models can better learn dependencies between papers and capture knowledge that spans across multiple documents. The representation of papers as nodes in a citation graph has enabled the development of more sophisticated models that leverage both textual content and network structure  (4, Gipp et al., 2022).\n\nRecent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have played a crucial role in this integration. For instance, Jeong et al. combined BERT with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to create a context-aware citation recommendation model that effectively represents citation relationships between papers  (15, Jeong et al., 2019). This approach has been further explored in various studies, with neural networks being trained on contextual content and bibliographic network linkages  (19, Hassan et al., 2020).\n\nThe use of graph embedding techniques to exploit citation graph structures has gained significant attention  (20, Qi et al., 2020). These methods allow for the learning of multi-vector distributed representations that capture both textual and graph-based information. Some notable approaches include DeepWalk, which employs truncated random walks on citation networks to learn paper representations  (41, Chen et al., 2022), and models that use GNNs to extract relationship structure information from document citation networks  (59, Gao et al., 2022).\n\nMore recent research has focused on integrating GNNs with large language models (LLMs) to provide high-quality text embedding while incorporating citation structure information  (75, Zhang et al., 2023). This fusion allows for better understanding of scientific literature and improved natural language processing capabilities. Additionally, some models treat citation as an information diffusion process, drawing parallels to cascade predictions in social networks  (77, Jiang et al., 2023).\n\nThe integration of citation graphs in neural models has led to improvements in various tasks, including topic prediction  (21, Cummings et al., 2020), citation prediction, and topic learning  (31, Du et al., 2021). These models can capture high-order relationships through information propagation in GNNs, enhancing their ability to model complex interactions between documents.\n\nAs the field continues to evolve, researchers are exploring more sophisticated techniques, such as adaptive feature learning and graph attention mechanisms, to further enrich the representation of scientific literature  (86, Liang et al., 2023). These advancements promise to enhance the capabilities of neural language models in processing and analyzing scientific papers by leveraging the wealth of information contained in citation networks.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The graph attention mechanism is used to sum the features of scientific literature with citation relationship, and give each scientific literature different feature weights\n\n\n\nImproving Document Embeddings with Citation Graphs\nTLDR: Citation graphs have been leveraged to enhance document embeddings for scientific papers, leading to more contextually rich representations. Models like SPECTER and graph-based approaches have shown improved performance in capturing document relatedness and scientific content.\n\nThe integration of citation graphs with document embeddings has emerged as a powerful approach to improve the representation of scientific papers in neural language models. SPECTER (Scientific Paper Embeddings using Citation-informed TransformERs) is a notable example of this integration, which generates document-level embeddings by pretraining a Transformer language model on papers' metadata and citation graphs  (1, Beltagy et al., 2020). This approach has gained traction in the research community, with several studies adopting or building upon SPECTER for various tasks related to scientific literature analysis  (42, Pornprasit et al., 2022)  (76, Guo et al., 2023).\n\nThe effectiveness of incorporating citation graph information into document embeddings has been demonstrated through comparative studies. Research has shown that graph-based methods, particularly those using heterogeneous graph transformers (HGT), can achieve slightly better results compared to sequence-based methods, highlighting the critical role of heterogeneous citation graph structure in generating context-rich embeddings  (5, Song et al., 2022).\n\nGraph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have also been employed to aggregate information from surrounding nodes in citation networks, enhancing document representations for tasks such as classification. The BertGCN model, which initializes paper node representations with BERT embeddings before applying graph convolutions, has shown improved performance over previous text graph methods by effectively incorporating both textual and citation information  (80, Ida et al., 2023).\n\nRecent approaches have explored combining pre-trained neural network models with citation network measures to create more comprehensive document representations. For instance, researchers have used SPECTER-generated embeddings in conjunction with network centrality measures to build predictive models of topical evolution in scientific literature  (57, Koneru et al., 2022).\n\nThe semantic content of papers has also been utilized to predict citation relationships, with models reconstructing adjacency matrices to capture potential citation links based on document similarities  (81, Liu et al., 2023). This approach leverages the intuition that papers with similar content are more likely to have citation relationships, further enhancing the quality of document embeddings.\n\nAs research in this area continues to evolve, the integration of citation graphs with document embeddings promises to provide increasingly sophisticated representations of scientific papers, enabling more accurate and contextually informed analysis of the scientific literature.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(1, Beltagy et al., 2020) | n_citations: 402 | SPECTER: Document-level Representation Learning using Citation-informed Transformers ]: \nStarting from the trained SciBERT model, we pretrain the Transformer parameters on the citation objective to learn paper representations that capture document relatedness...

Our model predicts citation relations by reconstructing the adjacency matrix A via Eq.10.\n\n\n\nEnhancing Scientific Paper Summarization\nTLDR: Citation graphs have been integrated into scientific paper summarization models to provide additional context and improve summary quality. These approaches leverage the relationships between papers to capture key contributions, background information, and community perspectives more effectively.\n\nThe incorporation of citation graphs has emerged as a promising approach to enhance scientific paper summarization. Traditionally, summarization models focused primarily on the content of individual papers, but recent research has demonstrated the value of considering the broader context provided by citation networks  (2, Wang et al., 2021). This shift in perspective has led to the development of more sophisticated summarization techniques that can capture both the authors' insights and the research community's views on a given paper.\n\nOne key advantage of using citation graphs for summarization is the ability to identify and incorporate salient content from referenced papers. Xie et al. proposed a citation-aware summarization framework that can accurately locate and integrate important information from references, while also capturing the varying relevance between source papers and their citations  (69, Xie et al., 2023). This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of a paper's background and main contributions.\n\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) have played a crucial role in leveraging citation information for summarization tasks. Zhang et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of a GNN encoder based on a pretrained language model for extractive summarization of scientific papers  (46, Zhang et al., 2022). This model obtains sentence representations for the target document and document representations for related papers in the citation graph, enabling a more nuanced selection of important content.\n\nThe integration of citation networks has also led to the development of novel datasets and benchmarks for scientific paper summarization. Zhong et al. introduced CiteSum, a large-scale extreme summarization benchmark derived from citation texts, which is significantly larger than previous human-annotated datasets  (45, Zhong et al., 2022). This resource provides researchers with valuable data to train and evaluate citation-aware summarization models.\n\nSome approaches have focused on combining the authors' perspective with the community's views to create more balanced summaries. Li et al. proposed models that use the paper's abstract as the authors' insight and identify cited text spans referred to by incoming citation sentences to represent the community's views  (14, Li et al., 2019). Additionally, they incorporated citation counts as a feature to reflect the authority of each work in the research community.\n\nAs the field progresses, researchers are exploring more efficient neural network architectures that can effectively incorporate graph-based features derived from citations  (68, Tang et al., 2023). These advancements promise to further improve the quality and comprehensiveness of scientific paper summaries by leveraging the rich information contained in citation networks.\n\nThe integration of citation graphs in summarization models has shown significant potential for enhancing the quality and contextual richness of scientific paper summaries. By capturing the interconnections between papers and incorporating diverse perspectives from the research community, these approaches are paving the way for more informative and accurate representations of scientific literature.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Currently, there are two main direction to further improve our citaion networks enhanced text summarisation: (1) The development of a more efficient neural network that can effectively incorporate the graph-based features derived from citations\n\n\n\nCitation Recommendation Systems\nTLDR: Citation recommendation systems leverage both textual content and citation graph structures to suggest relevant papers. These systems employ various techniques including neural networks, knowledge graph embeddings, and hybrid approaches to improve recommendation accuracy and relevance.\n\n\u2022 BERT-GCN Architecture: Jeong et al. proposed a context-aware citation recommendation model that combines BERT with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). This approach uses a Variational Graph AutoEncoder to create citation graph representations, enhancing the model's ability to capture relationships between papers  (78, Roethel et al., 2023).\n\n\u2022 Citation Intent Classification: Huynh et al. developed a model that incorporates both citation graphs and citation phrases for intent classification. Their research demonstrated that using citation graphs as additional context can significantly improve citation prediction accuracy  (50, Huynh et al., 2022).\n\n\u2022 Hybrid Global Citation Recommendation: Wu et al. introduced HC-SBDGA, a hybrid approach combining Siamese BERT and the C-KGAT algorithm. This method utilizes citation content for text feature extraction and incorporates knowledge graph data to recommend relevant citation resources  (90, Wu et al., 2023).\n\n\u2022 Knowledge Graph Embedding: Kim et al. addressed the challenge of different citation types by using a knowledge graph embedding approach with convolutional neural networks. This technique captures global citation behavior in heterogeneous citation networks  (23, Kim et al., 2020).\n\n\u2022 Seed Paper-Based Recommendation: Jia et al. adapted classic language models and graph embedding techniques to solve the problem of seed paper-based citation recommendation. Their approach embeds academic citation graphs to improve recommendation quality  (13, Jia et al., 2018).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(78, Roethel et al., 2023) | n_citations: 1 | Enriching language models with graph-based context information to better understand textual data ]: \nIn Jeong et al. (2020), the BERT-GCN architecture is proposed to recommend context-aware paper citations... In parallel, the citation graph representation is created using a Variational Graph AutoEncoder with a set of papers from a selected domain and their reference network.\n\n2. [(50, Huynh et al., 2022) | n_citations: 4 | GraphCite: Citation Intent Classification in Scientific Publications via Graph Embeddings ]: \nIn addition to textual clues present in the citation phrase, we also consider the citation graph, leveraging high-level information of citation patterns... we propose a new intent classification model that takes into account both the citation graph and the citation phrase... we show that using citation graphs as additional context for citation prediction can significantly improve upon state-of-the-art results.\n\n3. [(90, Wu et al., 2023) | n_citations: 0 | Hybrid Citation Recommendation Utilizing Siamese BERT and Dynamic Graph Attention Network ]: \nThis paper presents a hybrid global citation recommendation approach called HC-SBDGA.The algorithm combines Siamese BERT and the C-KGAT [6] algorithm to utilize citation content to extract text features and incorporate graph data from a knowledge graph to recommend relevant citation resources for researchers.\n\n4.

[(13, Jia et al., 2018) | n_citations: 4 | Graph Embedding for Citation Recommendation ]: \nThe techniques presented in this paper adapt the classic language model and graph embedding techniques discussed here and extend them to solve the problem of seed paper based citation recommendation by embedding an academic citation graph.\n\n\n\nIntegration with Transformer and Language Models\nTLDR: Transformer-based models and large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with citation graphs to enhance scientific paper analysis. This fusion combines the semantic understanding of text with the structural information from citation networks, leading to improved performance in various tasks such as citation recommendation, generation, and impact prediction.\n\nThe integration of citation graphs with transformer-based models and large language models has emerged as a powerful approach to improve the analysis and understanding of scientific literature. Researchers have explored various methods to combine the strengths of these models with the structural information provided by citation networks  (70, Kang et al., 2023).\n\nOne prominent approach involves using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in conjunction with citation graph information. Dinh et al. proposed a model that combines the attention mechanism and BERT to integrate citation contexts, titles, and author information  (73, Dinh et al., 2023). This integration allows for a more comprehensive representation of scientific papers, capturing both textual and relational aspects.\n\nSimilarly, Tian et al. developed a method that uses a citation-augmented corpus to finetune BERT, followed by the use of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to embed paper vectors based on citation relationships  (44, Tian et al., 2022). This approach demonstrates the potential of combining pre-trained language models with graph-based techniques to enhance document representations.\n\nThe integration of transformer models with citation graphs has also led to improvements in citation generation tasks. Ouyang et al. proposed a novel approach that conditions citation generation on the cited text span (CTS) rather than the abstract, showing that this method produces more accurate and faithful citations compared to abstract-based approaches  (74, Ouyang et al., 2023).\n\nResearchers have also explored the limitations of using only linguistic information in academic literature analysis. Shiro et al. highlighted the need for models that incorporate network information alongside linguistic data, suggesting that more advanced models than BERT alone may be necessary for predicting the impact of scholarly literature  (58, Shiro et al., 2022).\n\nRecent studies have focused on combining multiple techniques to create more comprehensive models. Lentini et al. proposed an approach that combines pre-trained deep NLP encoders for abstracts with random-walk based node embedding techniques applied to citation graphs  (55, Lentini et al., 2022). This fusion of methods aims to capture both semantic and structural information more effectively.\n\nThe integration of transformer-based models with citation graphs continues to evolve, with newer approaches exploring innovative combinations. For instance, Jin et al. introduced IdeaReader, which combines TF-IDF with Sentence-BERT for encoding paper abstracts and incorporates these embeddings with ProNE based on the citation structure  (95, Jin et al., 2024). This approach demonstrates the ongoing efforts to leverage both advanced language models and citation graph information for improved scientific literature analysis.\n\nAs research in this area progresses, the integration of transformer-based models and large language models with citation graphs promises to provide increasingly sophisticated tools for analyzing and understanding scientific papers, enhancing tasks such as citation recommendation, generation, and impact prediction.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(70, Kang et al., 2023) | n_citations: 8 | ConGraT: Self-Supervised Contrastive Pretraining for Joint Graph and Text Embeddings ]: \nSeveral recent works have used hyperlinks or citation graphs to inform language model (LM) training.\n\n2. [(73, Dinh et al., 2023) | n_citations: 3 | Enhanced context-aware citation recommendation with auxiliary textual information based on an auto-encoding mechanism ]: \nWe also combine the attention mechanism and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model [13] in the NCN model to integrate citation contexts, citation titles, citing authors and cited authors... The second solution is to integrate the BERT model [13] to preprocess the citation context information before entering the NCN model... We reconstructed the NCN model from the paper by F\u00e4rber et al. [12], by adding the BERT model\n\n3. [(44, Tian et al., 2022) | n_citations: 12 | Expert Systems With Applications ]: \nThe proposed method first uses a citation augmented corpus to lightly retrain and finetune BERT model... It uses vanilla BERT to encode query sentences into context embeddings, and uses GCN to embeds paper vectors which is obtained by Doc2Vec (Le & Mikolov, 2014) into graph embedding according to citation relationships.\n\n4. [(74, Ouyang et al., 2023) | n_citations: 3 | Cited Text Spans for Citation Text Generation ]: \nWe demonstrate empirically that the abstract is not always the most appropriate input for citation generation and that models trained in this way learn to hallucinate. We propose to condition instead on the cited text span (CTS) as an alternative to the abstract... we show that CTS-based citation text generation is more accurate and faithful than the abstract-based approaches used in prior work.\n\n5. [(58, Shiro et al., 2022) | n_citations: 0 | Classification of the Top-cited Literature by Fusing Linguistic and Citation Information with the Transformer Model ]: \nSeveral studies have pointed out that network information, rather than linguistic information, may be necessary for predicting the impact of scholarly literature... This result indicates the need to develop a more advanced model than the BERT model using only linguistic information in the academic literature, such as the SPECTOR model... with the top-cited papers as teacher data.\n\n6.

These designs aim to enhance the writing process through various forms of AI assistance, including summarization, feedback, and collaborative text generation.\n\n1. Text Editors with Integrated LLM Features: Advanced text editors now incorporate LLM-powered features to assist writers. For example, some tools provide continuously updated paragraph-wise summaries as margin annotations using automatic text summarization  (9, Benharrak et al., 2022). Others, like Textfocals, offer LLM-generated summaries, questions, and advice in a sidebar to encourage reflection and self-driven revision  (33, Haviland et al., 2024).\n\n2. Conversational Interfaces: Chat-based UIs, similar to ChatGPT, allow users to interact with AI writing assistants through natural language dialogues. These interfaces enable users to provide diverse writing instructions and receive AI-generated responses  (31, Hu et al., 2024). Some systems, like ConvXAI, use conversational AI explanations to provide writing feedback and help users enhance their papers  (16, Shen et al., 2023).\n\n3. Visual Programming and Rapid Prototyping: Tools like VISAR combine visual programming with text editing to help users explore and validate their writing plans. This approach allows writers to organize argument structures through synchronized text editing and visual programming interfaces  (13, Li et al., 2023).\n\n4. Semantic Authoring Interfaces: These UIs provide capabilities for writing and modifying semantically enriched documents, allowing users to add structured metadata to their content  (2, Auer et al., 2015).\n\n5. Hybrid Interfaces: Some tools combine multiple UI elements, such as integrating phrase suggestions with zero-shot prompt inputs to an LLM  (10, Lehmann et al., 2023). This approach allows for both guided and open-ended interactions with the AI writing assistant.\n\n6. Provenance-Tracking Interfaces: Tools like HaLLMark provide a web-based interface that not only facilitates writing with LLM support but also visualizes and stores the writer's interactions with the AI. This design helps writers retain agency, conform to policies, and transparently communicate their use of AI  (26, CHEVALIER et al., 2023).\n\n7. In-Place Editing Interfaces: Some AI writing tools offer interfaces that allow direct insertion or modification of AI-generated text within the document, providing a more seamless integration of human and AI contributions  (28, Musabirov et al., 2023).\n\nThese diverse UI designs reflect the ongoing exploration of effective ways to integrate AI assistance into the writing process, catering to different user needs and writing tasks.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The Baseline interface featured a conversational AI assistant similar to ChatGPT and the ability to insert AI generated text directly into the document.\n\n\n\nUI Features for Information Organization and Sense-Making\nTLDR: UI features for information organization and sense-making in AI writing tools include summarization, visual programming, and conversational interfaces. These features aim to help users structure their thoughts, explore ideas, and interact with complex information more effectively.\n\nAI-powered writing tools are incorporating various UI features to support information organization and sense-making processes. One prominent approach is the use of summarization techniques to help users grasp key ideas quickly. For instance, some text editors now provide continuously updated paragraph-wise summaries as margin annotations, using automatic text summarization to give writers a concise overview of their content  (9, Benharrak et al., 2022). Similarly, tools like Textfocals offer LLM-generated summaries, questions, and advice in a sidebar, encouraging reflection and self-driven revision without direct text generation  (33, Haviland et al., 2024).\n\nVisual programming interfaces are another innovative feature being explored to enhance information organization. VISAR, for example, combines visual programming with text editing, allowing users to organize argument structures through synchronized interfaces. This approach enables writers to explore, experiment with, and validate their writing plans using automatic draft prototyping  (13, Li et al., 2023). Such tools leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to support tasks beyond writing, including information seeking, consumption, learning, and prototyping  (14, Kim et al., 2023).\n\nConversational interfaces are also emerging as a powerful UI paradigm for sense-making. These interfaces can take the form of chatbots or voice assistants that report information from documents when queried  (9, Benharrak et al., 2022). More advanced systems like Qlarify envision an effortless, threaded interaction paradigm where questions naturally arise from interacting with an abstract, enabling users to engage with complex information more intuitively  (27, Chang et al., 2023).\n\nData-driven approaches are being used to enhance UI understanding and generation for various purposes, including accessibility, design semantics, and the creation of semantic representations from UIs. These techniques also facilitate the combination of programming-by-demonstration and natural language processing to understand and author multimodal UIs  (19, Lu et al., 2023). By integrating these advanced UI features, AI writing tools are evolving to provide more comprehensive support for information organization and sense-making, enhancing the overall writing and thinking process.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(14, Kim et al., 2023) | n_citations: 17 | Cells, Generators, and Lenses: Design Framework for Object-Oriented Interaction with Large Language Models ]: \nDue to the opportunities presented by these capabilities, HCI researchers have designed an assortment of interfaces that leverage LLMs to support a variety of user tasks beyond writing, such as information seeking and consumption [5,92], learning [55,57,63], and prototyping [49,74,76].\n\n5. [(27, Chang et al., 2023) | n_citations: 1 | Qlarify: Recursively Expandable Abstracts for Directed Information Retrieval over Scientific Papers ]: \nRecent advances in LLMs have seen the proliferation of prototypes for conversational question answering over long documents...

[(19, Lu et al., 2023) | n_citations: 10 | The Future of Computational Approaches for Understanding and Adapting User Interfaces ]: \nData-driven approaches have also been used to understand UIs for accessibility... learn design semantics... generate semantic representations from UIs... create documents without manually defining constraints and templates... and for combining programming-by-demonstration and natural language processing technologies to understand and author multimodal UIs\n\n\n\nInteraction Paradigms with Large Language Models\nTLDR: Interaction paradigms with LLMs in writing tools range from conversational interfaces to in-document assistance. These paradigms aim to enhance the writing process by providing contextual suggestions, enabling exploration of alternatives, and facilitating collaborative writing experiences.\n\nThe integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into writing tools has led to the development of various interaction paradigms that reshape how users engage with AI assistance during the writing process. One prominent approach is the use of conversational interfaces, similar to ChatGPT, which allow users to interact with AI writing assistants through natural language dialogues  (28, Musabirov et al., 2023). These chat-based interfaces enable users to explore alternatives, get answers to inquiries, and refine outcomes through direct interactions with the LLM  (18, Doh et al., 2023).\n\nAnother emerging paradigm is the in-place editing interface, where AI-generated text can be directly inserted or modified within the document  (28, Musabirov et al., 2023). This approach allows for a more seamless integration of AI assistance into the writing flow, with LLMs acting as collaborative co-writers that provide contextually relevant suggestions and expand on concepts  (32, Zheng et al., 2024).\n\nSome tools are exploring hybrid approaches that combine multiple interaction paradigms. For instance, interfaces may integrate phrase suggestions with zero-shot prompt inputs to an LLM, allowing for both guided and open-ended interactions  (10, Lehmann et al., 2023). This flexibility enables writers to benefit from different types of AI assistance depending on their current needs and writing tasks.\n\nResearchers are also investigating more nuanced ways of interacting with LLMs in writing tools. For example, the concept of \"diegetic\" and \"non-diegetic\" prompts has been proposed, distinguishing between prompts that are part of the narrative and those that provide external instructions to the LLM  (10, Lehmann et al., 2023). This conceptual distinction can help in designing more intuitive and context-aware interfaces for AI-assisted writing.\n\nTo facilitate effective human-AI collaboration, some tools focus on grounding interactions in shared artifacts, providing templates for prompt generation, and decomposing complex prompts to aid in debugging  (17, Gutierrez et al., 2023). These approaches aim to make the interaction with LLMs more transparent and manageable for users.\n\nAdvanced interaction paradigms are also being explored, such as Qlarify's vision of an effortless, threaded interaction where questions naturally arise from interacting with an abstract  (27, Chang et al., 2023). This approach aims to create a more intuitive and fluid interaction between the user and the AI assistant, particularly when dealing with complex information or long documents.\n\nSome tools, like Textfocals, take a different approach by providing LLM-generated summaries, questions, and advice in a sidebar, encouraging reflection and self-driven revision without direct text generation  (33, Haviland et al., 2024). This paradigm focuses on supporting the writing process through AI-powered insights rather than direct text production.\n\nAs these interaction paradigms continue to evolve, they are shaping a new user interface landscape in writing tools, offering diverse ways for users to leverage the capabilities of LLMs in their writing processes. The ongoing development of these paradigms reflects the broader trend of integrating AI assistance into creative and cognitive tasks, with a focus on enhancing user agency and productivity.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Key considerations include user experience, interface affordances, and collaborative writing paradigms.\n\nThe development of AI-assisted writing interfaces brings forth several design challenges and important considerations. One of the primary challenges is effectively communicating the capabilities of AI systems to users. As Wattenberg et al. point out, \"A common struggle with modern generative AI is understanding what it can actually do-what its capabilities are\"  (20, Wattenberg et al., 2023). This challenge is compounded by the rapid evolution of AI technologies, making it difficult for interface designers to create clear affordances that accurately represent the system's abilities.\n\nIntegrating AI assistance seamlessly into existing writing workflows is another crucial consideration. Mobeirek et al. emphasize that \"users want AI-assisted writing tools that are well integrated and easy to use\" and that \"Future AI-assisted writing tools need to closely consider their user experience design choices to create a seamless design integrated into the document editor\"  (23, Mobeirek et al., 2023). This integration requires careful attention to user experience design to ensure that AI assistance enhances rather than disrupts the writing process.\n\nBalancing user control with AI assistance is a delicate design challenge. Buschek et al. highlight the \"Challenge of Envisioning Interaction with AI\" and suggest using familiar UI concepts like autocompletion as a conceptual lens for designing interactive intelligent systems  (4, Buschek et al., 2020). This approach can help bridge the gap between traditional interface design and the new paradigms required for AI-assisted writing.\n\nThe development of innovative UI technologies and design standards for intelligent human-computer interaction is an ongoing process. Xu suggests that this will \"ultimately prompt the development of more natural and effective IUI and will require HCI/UX professionals to develop more effective approaches to explore the design of innovative UI design\"  (24, Xu, 2023). This includes exploring visualization techniques and other novel interface elements to enhance the user's understanding and control of AI-assisted writing tools.\n\nCollaborative writing paradigms present unique challenges in the context of AI assistance. Lehmann notes the need for \"designing, implementing, and evaluating functional prototypes for understanding human-AI interactions\" and plans to \"carry out more studies on collaborative writing\"  (21, Lehmann, 2023). Understanding how AI can effectively support collaborative writing processes without diminishing human creativity and agency is a critical area for future research and design efforts.\n\nFinally, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into writing assistants introduces new interaction paradigms that need careful consideration. Bhat et al. discuss how \"meta-prompting strategy in Wordcraft provides alternative prompts to the users, assisting in the specification stage\"  (25, Bhat et al., 2023). This approach exemplifies the potential for AI to not only assist in writing but also in guiding users through the creative process, highlighting the need for interfaces that can effectively mediate this complex human-AI collaboration.\n\nReferences:\n1.

It employs convolution to expand the temporal receptive field and can be applied to various stimulus representations like speech envelopes.\n\nThe Temporal Response Function (TRF) is a crucial tool in analyzing the relationship between auditory stimuli and neural responses. It is conceptually similar to the Spectro-Temporal Response Function (STRF), which is defined as a linear mapping from the stimulus spectrogram to a neuron's instantaneous firing rate response  (1, SHAMMA et al., 2007). The TRF extends this concept by establishing an integrated linear response of neural activity over time, using convolution in the temporal dimension to expand the temporal receptive field  (10, Yu et al., 2022).\n\nIn the context of auditory speech perception, TRFs are system response functions that describe the relationship between acoustic cues and recorded neural activity  (6, Kuruvila et al., 2021). The most commonly used acoustic cue in TRF analysis is the speech envelope, which represents the temporal fluctuations in the amplitude of the speech signal  (6, Kuruvila et al., 2021)  (7, Katthi et al., 2021).\n\nThe TRF can be understood as an optimal linear filter that transforms one signal into another, typically relating the stimulus (e.g., speech envelope) to the neural response (e.g., EEG recordings)  (11, Zhang et al., 2022). This linear time-invariant system model allows researchers to examine how different aspects of the auditory stimulus are reflected in neural activity over time.\n\nOne notable application of TRFs in auditory attention research has revealed that TRFs corresponding to attended speakers show more salient peaks around 100 and 200 ms compared to TRFs for ignored speakers  (6, Kuruvila et al., 2021). This demonstrates the TRF's ability to capture attentional modulation of neural responses to speech.\n\nThe computational efficiency of TRF analysis is worth noting, as temporal convolution for a TRF module with a receptive field of size K_F requires only O(K_F) time complexity per element  (10, Yu et al., 2022). This efficiency allows for the analysis of complex temporal relationships between stimuli and neural responses in a computationally tractable manner.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The predictive power of the TRF was defined as the correlation coefficient between the predicted envelope and the actual broadband envelope, which was averaged over the 10 folds.\n\n\n\nStimulus Representation\nTLDR: Various methods are used to represent auditory stimuli in TRF analysis, with speech envelope being the most common. More complex representations like gammatone spectrograms can also be employed to capture detailed acoustic features.\n\n1. Speech Envelope: The most commonly used acoustic cue in TRF analysis is the speech envelope, which represents the temporal fluctuations in the amplitude of the speech signal  (6, Kuruvila et al., 2021)  (9, Kuruvila et al., 2021). It can be computed using the Hilbert transform  (12, Geirnaert et al., 2022).\n\n2. Time-lagged Copies: To allow for spectral filtering, the stimulus representation can include the speech envelope and several time-lagged copies of it  (12, Geirnaert et al., 2022).\n\n3. Gammatone Spectrogram: This method estimates cochlear transformations and provides a high-dimensional representation with numerous time series representing acoustic power at different frequency bands  (14, Brodbeck et al., 2023). It simulates the representation of stimuli in the auditory nerve  (1, SHAMMA et al., 2007).\n\n4. Speech Spectrograms: TRFs can map relationships between speech spectrograms and cortical signals, offering a more detailed representation of the acoustic input  (9, Kuruvila et al., 2021).\n\n5. Phoneme-based Representation: TRFs can also be used to map relationships between phonemes and cortical signals, providing a linguistic-level representation of speech  (9, Kuruvila et al., 2021).\n\n6. Same-frequency, Inhibitory-Excitatory (SFIE) Model: This phenomenological model can be used to simulate responses of different types of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) to speech sounds  (15, Lindboom et al., 2023).\n\n7. 1D Preprocessed Stimuli Envelopes: Some methods use preprocessed one-dimensional stimuli envelopes as input for TRF analysis  (7, Katthi et al., 2021).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Then, the SFIE model (Carney and McDonough, 2019) was used to simulate responses of two types of IC neurons: band-enhanced (BE) and band-suppressed (BS) neurons... More specifically, in this work, the SFIE midbrain model was used to produce model IC responses to speech which, in turn, were used to derive TRFs for predicting EEG responses.\n\n7.

For the speech dataset, the methods are performed on the preprocessed 1D stimuli envelopes and 128D EEG responses.\n\n\n\nNeural Response Representation\nTLDR: Neural response representation in TRF analysis varies based on recording techniques, from large-scale EEG to single-neuron iEEG. The analysis can reveal hierarchical processing of speech features across different brain regions.\n\nIn TRF analysis, the representation of neural responses depends on the recording technique used. EEG provides a broad, large-scale view of neural activity, while more invasive methods like ECoG and iEEG offer higher spatial resolution and the ability to capture activity from smaller populations of neurons  (13, Manning, 2022). In cases where microwires are used for iEEG recordings, it's even possible to record action potentials from individual neurons, providing an extremely fine-grained representation of neural activity  (13, Manning, 2022).\n\nThe choice of neural response representation can reveal different aspects of speech processing in the brain. For instance, TRF analysis has shown a hierarchy of temporal receptive fields associated with various levels of speech processing, from acoustic features to paragraph-level comprehension, along the temporoparietal axis in both hemispheres  (5, Caucheteux et al., 2021). This hierarchical representation extends beyond traditional language areas, with regions like the precuneus and superior frontal areas showing sentence- and paragraph-level TRFs  (5, Caucheteux et al., 2021).\n\nIn practical applications, such as in attention decoding tasks, the neural response is typically represented as EEG signals. The TRF analysis involves a two-stage process: a training stage where time-lagged speech features are mapped to the EEG response to derive TRFs for each speaker, and a testing stage to assess how well the EEG responses can be predicted  (16, Alickovic et al., 2023). This approach allows researchers to quantify the relationship between speech stimuli and neural responses, providing insights into auditory attention and speech processing mechanisms.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(13, Manning, 2022) | n_citations: 0 | Identifying stimulus-driven neural activity patterns in multi-patient intracranial recordings ]: \nWhen sensors are smaller and placed in direct contact with signal sources, as in ECoG and iEEG, the sensors pick up on smaller populations of neurons that are closer to the recording surface of the electrodes...

Notably, both the model-free and model-based methods evidence that the precuneus, the superior frontal gyrus and sulcus are characterized by sentenceand paragraph-level TRFs\n\n3. [(16, Alickovic et al., 2023) | n_citations: 0 | Predicting EEG Responses to Attended Speech via Deep Neural Networks for Speech ]: \nNT methods involve encoding of the speech by estimating the temporal response function (TRF) that linearly maps time-lagged speech signals to EEG... It includes two stages: a training stage to derive TRFs for the each talker and a testing stage to quantify how well EEG responses can be predicted... In the training stage, time-lagged speech features of each talker S are linearly mapped to the EEG response(s) R of the listener based on TRF W derived via regularized linear regression (rLR) with a parameter \u03bb to control for overfitting\n\n\n\nTRF Estimation and Analysis\nTLDR: TRF estimation involves linear regression models to map stimuli to neural responses. Analysis techniques include predictive power assessment and regularization to prevent overfitting.\n\nThe estimation and analysis of Temporal Response Functions (TRFs) are crucial steps in understanding the relationship between auditory stimuli and neural responses. TRF models are typically designed as linear regression models that predict neural responses based on a fixed time-lag window of past sensory stimuli  (8, Chehab et al., 2021). This approach can be expressed as a control-driven linear dynamics equation, where the convolution kernel maps the stimuli to the brain response  (8, Chehab et al., 2021).\n\nThe TRF estimation process often involves two stages: a training stage and a testing stage  (16, Alickovic et al., 2023). In the training stage, time-lagged speech features of each speaker are linearly mapped to the EEG response of the listener. This mapping is achieved through regularized linear regression (rLR), which helps control for overfitting by introducing a regularization parameter \u03bb  (16, Alickovic et al., 2023).\n\nOnce the TRF is estimated, its performance can be evaluated using various analysis techniques. One common method is to assess the predictive power of the TRF, which is defined as the correlation coefficient between the predicted envelope and the actual broadband envelope  (11, Zhang et al., 2022). This measure is typically averaged over multiple folds in a cross-validation procedure to ensure robustness.\n\nIt's worth noting that the computational efficiency of TRF analysis has been improved through the use of temporal convolution. For a TRF module with a receptive field of size K_F, the time complexity per element is only O(K_F)  (10, Yu et al., 2022). This efficiency allows for the analysis of more complex temporal relationships between stimuli and neural responses.\n\nIn the context of auditory speech perception, TRF analysis can reveal important insights into how the brain processes speech signals. By examining the estimated TRFs, researchers can identify which aspects of the speech signal (e.g., envelope, spectral features) are most strongly represented in the neural response, and at what time lags these representations occur. This information can be crucial for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech perception and auditory attention.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Temporal convolution (Equation 6) needs just O(K F ) time complexity per element for a TRF module with a K F receptive field\n\n\n\nApplications in Auditory Speech Perception\nTLDR: TRFs are widely used in auditory speech perception research to study attention, speech tracking, and neural processing hierarchies. They can be applied to various aspects of speech, from acoustic features to higher-level linguistic structures, revealing how different brain regions process speech information.\n\nTemporal Response Functions (TRFs) have become a valuable tool in auditory speech perception research, offering insights into how the brain processes and attends to speech signals. One of the most prominent applications of TRFs is in the study of auditory attention. Research has shown that TRFs corresponding to attended speakers exhibit more salient peaks around 100 and 200 ms compared to those of ignored speakers  (6, Kuruvila et al., 2021). This finding is consistent across studies using electroencephalography (EEG), where TRFs demonstrate high temporal resolution with peaks at these time points that modulate the attentional effect  (9, Kuruvila et al., 2021).\n\nTRFs are not limited to analyzing speech envelopes but can be applied to various representations of speech. They can map linear relationships between speech spectrograms and cortical signals, as well as between phonemes and cortical responses  (9, Kuruvila et al., 2021). This versatility allows researchers to investigate different aspects of speech processing, from low-level acoustic features to higher-level linguistic structures.\n\nIn the context of speech tracking, TRFs have been instrumental in revealing how cortical signals track the envelope of attended speech more strongly than that of interfering speech  (9, Kuruvila et al., 2021). This phenomenon has been repeatedly established in EEG studies, leading to the development of advanced analysis techniques. For instance, the Speech-Interference Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (SI-GCCA) framework uses speech envelopes computed via Hilbert transform, along with time-lagged copies, to allow for spectral filtering in attention decoding tasks  (12, Geirnaert et al., 2022).\n\nTRF analysis has also revealed a hierarchical organization of speech processing in the brain. Studies have shown that there is a hierarchy of temporal receptive fields associated with acoustic, word, sentence, and paragraph processing along the temporoparietal axis in both hemispheres  (5, Caucheteux et al., 2021). Interestingly, this hierarchical representation extends beyond traditional language areas, with regions like the precuneus and superior frontal areas showing sentence- and paragraph-level TRFs  (5, Caucheteux et al., 2021).\n\nRecent advancements in TRF applications include the use of phenomenological models to simulate responses of different types of neurons to speech sounds. For example, the same-frequency, inhibitory-excitatory (SFIE) model has been used to simulate responses of band-enhanced (BE) and band-suppressed (BS) neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC)  (15, Lindboom et al., 2023). These model IC responses can then be used to derive TRFs for predicting EEG responses, providing a more detailed understanding of how subcortical structures contribute to speech perception.\n\nIn summary, TRFs have proven to be a versatile and powerful tool in auditory speech perception research, enabling researchers to investigate attention mechanisms, speech tracking, hierarchical processing, and the contributions of various brain regions to speech comprehension.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Different frequency bands of P-waves can be used for various applications in seismic analysis and discrimination.\n\nP-waves, as impulsive seismic sources, are characterized by their broadband nature, meaning they contain energy across a wide spectrum of frequencies  (4, Audet et al., 2020). This property makes P-waves particularly useful for various seismic analysis techniques. For instance, in onsite warning systems, the predominant periods of the first few seconds of P-waves at single stations are utilized to evaluate source magnitude or ground shaking  (3, Zhang et al., 2020). To enhance P-wave detection in complex seismic environments, some researchers employ multiband filtering techniques, separating raw seismograms into several logarithmically spaced narrow frequency bands before applying kurtosis-based characteristic functions  (4, Audet et al., 2020).\n\nThe frequency content of P-waves also plays a crucial role in seismic discrimination, particularly for small-magnitude events. Recent studies have shown that high-frequency P/S amplitude ratios can potentially be used for distinguishing between different types of seismic events at local distances  (6, Kong et al., 2022). This approach leverages the fact that P-waves and S-waves may exhibit different spectral characteristics, allowing for more accurate discrimination when analyzed in specific frequency bands.\n\nIn summary, the broadband nature of P-waves, their predominant periods in the initial seconds, and their high-frequency content relative to other wave types all contribute to their distinct frequency characteristics.

Second, the model focuses on different frequency bands for P and S.\n\n\n\nAmplitude-based methods for P-wave identification\nTLDR: Amplitude-based methods utilize the relative strengths of P-waves compared to other seismic waves for identification and analysis. These techniques include using amplitude ratios, predominant periods, and multi-station comparisons for various seismic applications.\n\nAmplitude-based methods play a crucial role in distinguishing P-waves from other seismic waves and are employed in various applications, from early warning systems to seismic event discrimination. One common approach is the amplitude ratio (Ar) method, which compares the amplitudes of P-waves and S-waves in the time domain  (7, Ahn et al., 2022). This technique leverages the typically higher amplitudes of P-waves relative to S-waves in the initial stages of seismic recordings.\n\nIn onsite warning systems, the amplitudes of the first few seconds of P-waves at single stations are utilized alongside predominant periods to evaluate source magnitude or ground shaking potential  (3, Zhang et al., 2020). This rapid analysis of P-wave characteristics allows for quick assessment of seismic events, crucial for timely warning dissemination.\n\nFor regional warning systems, a multi-station approach is often employed. This method uses arrival times and amplitudes of P-waves recorded at multiple stations to estimate earthquake locations and magnitudes  (3, Zhang et al., 2020). The use of multiple stations enhances the accuracy and reliability of seismic event characterization.\n\nRecent research has shown promise in using high-frequency P/S amplitude ratios for small-magnitude seismic discrimination. By averaging these ratios over many stations at local distances, researchers have demonstrated the potential to distinguish between different types of seismic events  (6, Kong et al., 2022). This approach takes advantage of the different spectral characteristics of P-waves and S-waves, focusing on specific frequency bands to enhance discrimination capabilities.\n\nIn summary, amplitude-based methods for P-wave identification and analysis range from simple time-domain comparisons to more complex multi-station, frequency-specific techniques. These methods provide valuable tools for seismologists and early warning system operators to quickly and accurately characterize seismic events based on P-wave properties.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Second, the model focuses on different frequency bands for P and S.\n\n\n\nComparative analysis with other seismic waves\nTLDR: P-waves exhibit distinct characteristics compared to other seismic waves, particularly S-waves, in terms of arrival time, velocity, and frequency content. These differences are leveraged in various seismic analysis techniques for wave identification and event discrimination.\n\n- P-waves arrive earlier and travel faster than S-waves, making them the first detectable signals in seismic recordings. This property allows for their identification across a wide range of epicentral distances (3-100 km)  (1, Ross et al., 2018).\n\n- The velocity difference between P-waves and other seismic waves is significant. For instance, in certain materials, fast P-waves can travel at speeds of 2,715.6 m s^-1, while slower waves attenuate quickly with distance from the source  (5, Wolf et al., 2021).\n\n- P-waves have distinct waveform characteristics that allow for their differentiation from noise and S-waves. Machine learning classifiers can be trained to distinguish P-phases from other signals based on features extracted from time windows near arrival times  (2, Shen et al., 2019).\n\n- High-frequency content is a key distinguishing feature of P-waves. The P/S amplitude ratios in high-frequency bands have shown potential for small-magnitude seismic discrimination when averaged over multiple stations at local distances  (6, Kong et al., 2022).\n\n- P-waves typically exhibit higher initial amplitudes compared to S-waves, which is useful for early detection and characterization of seismic events (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These interfaces often incorporate machine learning capabilities to assist users in tasks such as data labeling, model probing, and performance analysis.\n\nResearchers have created a diverse array of interfaces to support the behavioral evaluation of machine learning models, each designed to address specific aspects of the evaluation process. One notable category is interactive annotation platforms, which aim to streamline the labeling process and improve annotation efficiency. For instance, INCEpTION is an annotation platform that incorporates machine learning capabilities to actively assist and guide annotators  (12, Bugert et al., 2018). Similarly, NOVA offers semi-automated annotations and provides visual feedback to inspect and correct machine-generated labels, incorporating eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques  (23, Schuller et al., 2020)  (35, Weitz et al., 2022).\n\nAnother approach focuses on programming the labeling process itself. Snorkel, for example, enables users to program the machine learning stack by using labeling functions rather than manual annotation  (17, Ratner et al., 2019). This approach can significantly reduce the need for manual labeling efforts.\n\nVisualization tools play a crucial role in helping users understand and evaluate model behavior. EMILE-UI is an interactive visualization tool that allows users to evaluate explanations provided by saliency maps for image-based classification tasks  (46, Kadir et al., 2023). Similarly, the What-If Tool (WIT) is an interactive system that shows model behavior based on user input scenarios  (31, Wojtusiak et al., 2021).\n\nInteractive machine learning (IML) interfaces have been developed to tighten the loop between labeled data collection and model development.

Such approaches aim to minimize human time and effort by collecting labels as efficiently as possible.\n\nSome interfaces focus on specific aspects of the evaluation process. For example, ModelTracker offers end-user interaction with ML evaluation results, such as model performance  (10, Kim et al., 2017). Others, like the tool developed by Ren et al., allow for debugging multiple classifiers  (27, Chang et al., 2020).\n\nFlexible annotation systems have also been developed, allowing users to perform various types of annotations either manually, semi-automatically, or automatically  (4, Barbu, 2000). These systems often integrate different processing tools to speed up human annotation efforts.\n\nIn summary, researchers have developed a wide range of interfaces to support behavioral evaluation of ML models, from comprehensive annotation platforms to specialized visualization tools.

We also show how different processing tools can be integrated in the system in order to speed up the human annotation\n\n\n\nMachine learning integration to accelerate annotation\nTLDR: Machine learning techniques are increasingly integrated into annotation tools to accelerate the process and reduce human effort. These approaches include active learning, semi-automated labeling, and visual feedback systems that allow users to verify and correct machine-generated annotations efficiently.\n\nResearchers have developed various strategies to integrate machine learning into annotation tools, significantly reducing the time and effort required for manual labeling. One prominent approach is the use of semi-automated annotation systems, which provide machine-generated labels for human verification and correction. For example, NOVA offers semi-automated annotations with visual feedback, allowing users to inspect and correct machine-generated labels  (23, Schuller et al., 2020) (19, Andr\u00e9 et al., 2019). Similarly, INCEpTION incorporates machine learning capabilities to actively assist and guide annotators  (12, Bugert et al., 2018).\n\nActive learning techniques are widely employed to minimize human effort by focusing on the most informative samples. APLenty, for instance, uses active and proactive learning to make dataset creation easier and less time-consuming  (14, Ananiadou et al., 2018). Some tools, like the one presented by Zhang et al., use bootstrapped classifiers to generate automatic annotations, reducing annotation time by a factor of six  (5, Zhang et al., 2006).\n\nExplainable AI (XAI) techniques are increasingly integrated into annotation tools to provide users with confidence values and visual explanations for machine-generated labels  (35, Weitz et al., 2022). This integration helps annotators understand whether they can trust the ML models or if more annotated data is necessary (19, Andr\u00e9 et al., 2019).\n\nInteractive machine learning (IML) interfaces have been developed to tighten the loop between labeled data collection and model development. These interfaces iteratively sample unlabeled data for annotation, train new models, and display feedback on the model's estimated performance  (37, Harper et al., 2022). Tools like D-WISE offer an interactive process where machine learning suggestions improve over time as annotators accept, reject, or correct them  (36, Koch et al., 2022).\n\nSome approaches focus on programming the labeling process itself. Snorkel, for example, enables users to program the machine learning stack using labeling functions rather than manual annotation  (17, Ratner et al., 2019). This approach can significantly reduce the need for manual labeling efforts.\n\nTo further expedite annotation without sacrificing validity, researchers have developed tools that incorporate machine learning recommenders. These systems suggest possible annotations, which users can accept, reject, or correct, with the feedback used to update the recommender model in the background  (15, Klie, 2018).\n\nIn summary, the integration of machine learning techniques into annotation tools has led to significant advancements in accelerating the annotation process. From semi-automated labeling to active learning and explainable AI, these approaches aim to reduce human effort while maintaining annotation quality. As the field progresses, we can expect further innovations in leveraging machine learning to streamline and enhance the annotation process for behavioral evaluation of ML models.\n\nReferences:\n1.

One of the practical methods is the Backtracking Spiral Algorithm (BSA), which is efficient and complete coverage guaranteed.\n\n\n\nEffectiveness Criteria for Floor-Cleaning Robots\nTLDR: Effective floor-cleaning robots employ algorithms that ensure complete coverage, minimize turning and energy consumption, and adapt to dynamic environments. Key criteria include efficient path planning, obstacle avoidance, and the ability to handle various room layouts and cleaning requirements.\n\nThe effectiveness of floor-cleaning robots is primarily determined by their ability to achieve complete coverage of the cleaning area while optimizing efficiency. Complete Coverage Path Planning (CCPP) is a fundamental approach used by many cleaning robots to ensure that every accessible area in the workspace is visited  (59, Huang et al., 2018). Effective algorithms focus on reducing turning and total cost, allowing robots to complete coverage more quickly and efficiently  (12, Yan et al., 2021).\n\nOne key criterion for effectiveness is the robot's ability to handle dynamic environments and overcome obstacles. Algorithms that can deal with deadlock problems and guarantee collision-free coverage in changing surroundings are particularly valuable  (59, Huang et al., 2018). Additionally, the capacity to re-plan paths for areas missed during initial cleaning due to obstacle avoidance is crucial for thorough cleaning  (70, Chen et al., 2019).\n\nMinimizing turns is another important factor in robot efficiency. Approaches that employ cellular decomposition and flow networks can provide path planning that guarantees minimal turning of the robots  (3, Seungbin et al., 2005). This is particularly important as excessive turning can increase energy consumption and cleaning time.\n\nAdaptability to various room layouts and cleaning requirements is also essential. Some algorithms, like the Squircular-CPP, offer smooth coverage paths that can fit shapes between ellipses and rectangles, demonstrating flexibility in different environments  (82, Chen et al., 2020). Furthermore, the ability to access narrow areas through size adaptability enhances the robot's effectiveness in real-world settings  (105, Kalimuthu et al., 2022).\n\nWhile optimal path planning is crucial, it's important to note that human cleaning patterns are not always optimal in terms of time but are tailored to specific areas and cleaning purposes  (21, Lee et al., 2007). Effective cleaning robots should balance optimal coverage with practical cleaning strategies.\n\nMulti-robot systems have shown promise in improving work capacity and reducing the time required to complete sweeping tasks  (16, Yang et al., 2002)  (60, Philip et al., 2018). These systems can be particularly effective in large or complex environments.\n\nLastly, as the market for robotic floor cleaners grows, the development of benchmark schemes to validate cleaning performance and coverage efficacy becomes increasingly important  (60, Philip et al., 2018). Comparative studies between new algorithms and standard coverage path planning techniques can help evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches  (115, Ermini et al., 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Modern algorithms combine mapping techniques, real-time path planning, and obstacle avoidance strategies to ensure efficient and complete coverage in dynamic settings.\n\nFloor-cleaning robots face numerous environmental challenges that significantly impact their effectiveness. A key consideration is the ability to navigate and clean in both static and dynamic environments. Many modern approaches utilize grid-based mapping techniques to model the cleaning area, allowing robots to plan efficient paths and adapt to obstacles (4, Xi-feng, 2006)  (7, Sun et al., 2017).\n\nThe transition from simple random walks to more sophisticated, environment-aware approaches has been a crucial development in floor-cleaning robotics. Some advanced models now incorporate room mapping capabilities using sensors like LiDAR, enabling more intelligent and efficient cleaning strategies  (11, Sun et al., 2020). This environmental awareness allows robots to create more effective coverage paths and adapt to various room layouts.\n\nObstacle avoidance is a critical aspect of environmental navigation for cleaning robots. Algorithms that can handle dynamic obstacles and update their paths in real-time are particularly valuable. For instance, some approaches use a rolling window technique combined with distance transform algorithms to continuously update the local grid map and plan coverage paths as the robot encounters new obstacles  (7, Sun et al., 2017).\n\nDealing with deadlock problems in dynamic environments is another crucial challenge. Novel Complete Coverage Path Planning (CCPP) algorithms have been developed to ensure efficient, collision-free coverage in changing surroundings  (59, Huang et al., 2018). These algorithms allow robots to navigate complex, apartment-like environments while maintaining high cleaning efficiency.\n\nSome research has explored biologically inspired neural network approaches for complete coverage path planning with obstacle avoidance in non-stationary environments  (2, Luo et al., 2002). These methods aim to mimic natural problem-solving strategies to improve robot navigation and adaptability.\n\nRecent advancements include the development of hinged-reconfigurable robots that can alter their footprint shape to better navigate and clean in various environments  (119, Muthugala et al., 2023). This adaptability allows robots to access narrow spaces and improve overall coverage.\n\nSimulation tools like WEBOTS have been used to design and test intelligent path planning solutions for floor sweeping robots, focusing on high coverage and low repetition in cleaning tasks  (121, Qin et al., 2023). These simulations help in developing algorithms that enable robots to effectively avoid obstacles while maintaining efficient cleaning patterns.\n\nSome approaches also consider user interaction and control as part of environmental adaptation. For example, some robots can be controlled via smartphone applications, allowing users to guide the robot's movements and actions in response to specific environmental needs  (114, Naveen et al., 2023).\n\nIn summary, effective floor-cleaning robots must employ sophisticated algorithms that combine environmental mapping, real-time path planning, and obstacle avoidance strategies. These features allow robots to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, ensuring complete coverage while navigating around obstacles and optimizing cleaning efficiency.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These structures often achieve O(n) space and O(1) query time complexity.\n\n- Specialized RMQ Structures: Recent research has proposed novel approaches to RMQ, such as the DPPDGP-Min1 and DPPDGP-Min2 methods  (17, Markatou et al., 2022). These structures aim to optimize specific aspects of RMQ performance.\n\n- Space-Efficient Structures: Some RMQ data structures focus on minimizing space usage while maintaining reasonable query times. For example, a structure using 2n+n/(log n t) \u03a9(t) + O(n^(3/4)) bits of space with O(t) query time has been proposed  (15, Yu et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:\n1.

The two in-block RMQ can be easily answered by querying on at most two segment trees\n\n4. [(6, Durocher, 2011) | n_citations: 15 | A Simple Linear-Space Data Structure for Constant-Time Range Minimum Query ]: \nSeveral O(n), O(1) RMQ data structures exist, many of which depend on the equivalence between the range minimum query and lowest common ancestor (LCA) problems.\n\n5.

[DPPDGP18] proposed two approaches to the RMQ problem which we refer to as DPPDGP-Min1 and DPPDGP-Min2.\n\n\n\nSpace and Time Complexities\nTLDR: RMQ data structures offer various trade-offs between space usage and query time. While some achieve constant query time with linear space, others prioritize space efficiency at the cost of slightly increased query times.\n\nThe space and time complexities of Range Minimum Query (RMQ) data structures have been a subject of extensive research, with various approaches offering different trade-offs:\n\n- Linear Space, Constant Query Time: A fundamental result in RMQ research is the existence of data structures that use O(n) space and support constant-time queries  (5, Larsen et al., 2011). This approach, often referred to as the \"textbook solution,\" forms the basis for many RMQ implementations  (16, Liu, 2021).\n\n- Space-Efficient Structures: Recent advancements have focused on reducing space requirements while maintaining reasonable query times. A notable structure uses 2n+o(n) bits of space with O(1) query time, achieved through clever use of Cartesian Trees  (1, Fischer, 2007). Further improvements have led to structures using 2n+n/(log n t) \u03a9(t) + O(n^(3/4)) bits of space with O(t) query time  (15, Yu et al., 2020).\n\n- Sublinear Space Structures: For scenarios where space is at a premium, structures with sublinear space usage have been developed. These typically come at the cost of increased query time, with some achieving O(log n) query time  (11, Gawrychowski et al., 2018).\n\n- Multi-dimensional RMQ: The complexity increases for higher-dimensional RMQ problems. For 2D range minimum queries, data structures with O(n log^\u03b5 n) space and O(log log U) query time have been developed  (4, Chan et al., 2011).\n\n- Practical Considerations: Many modern RMQ structures use a combination of techniques to balance space and time complexities. For instance, some employ segment trees for efficient in-block queries within larger RMQ structures  (15, Yu et al., 2020), while others leverage prepared overlapping RMQ queries to optimize performance  (16, Liu, 2021).\n\nThese diverse approaches to RMQ data structures allow developers to choose the most suitable solution based on their specific requirements for space efficiency and query performance.\n\nReferences:\n1.

They serve as fundamental building blocks for solving problems in string processing, tree algorithms, and geometric computations.\n\n- Suffix Trees and String Processing: RMQ structures are essential components in the construction and operation of suffix trees, which are widely used in string algorithms  (8, Kowalski et al., 2017)  (9, Grabowski et al., 2017). They enable efficient solutions to problems such as the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) and Longest Common Extension (LCE) on strings  (12, Fineman et al., 2019)  (13, Munro et al., 2019).\n\n- Tree Algorithms: RMQ structures are fundamental in solving the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) problem on rooted trees, which has applications in various tree-based algorithms  (12, Fineman et al., 2019). They are also used to compute suffix links in suffix trees  (13, Munro et al., 2019).\n\n- Geometric Computations: RMQ solutions contribute to efficient algorithms for two-dimensional grids and orthogonal range searching problems  (8, Kowalski et al., 2017)  (13, Munro et al., 2019).\n\n- Graph Algorithms: RMQ structures serve as building blocks for various graph-related problems, enhancing the efficiency of algorithms in this domain  (12, Fineman et al., 2019).\n\n- Document Retrieval: RMQ data structures can be employed to speed up document retrieval queries, improving search performance in information retrieval systems  (13, Munro et al., 2019).\n\n- Sequence Analysis: RMQ structures facilitate efficient algorithms for finding maximal-scoring subsequences, which has applications in bioinformatics and data analysis  (13, Munro et al., 2019).\n\n- Data Compression: RMQ solutions contribute to the computation of Lempel-Ziv-77 factorizations when only the suffix array is available, aiding in data compression techniques  (13, Munro et al., 2019).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These datasets often contain millions of samples and cover diverse domains to enhance model generalization and performance on downstream tasks.\n\n\u2022 Web Tables and Spreadsheets: Many pre-training approaches utilize large collections of web tables and spreadsheets. For instance, Han et al. use a mixture of WikiTable, WDC, and Spreadsheet datasets  (1, Han et al., 2020). Similarly, TaBERT is trained on a corpus of 26 million tables and their English contexts  (15, Yin et al., 2020).\n\n\u2022 Wikipedia-based Datasets: WikiSQL, containing 80,654 hand-annotated examples of questions and SQL queries across 24,241 Wikipedia tables, is a notable dataset for table-related tasks  (14, Xiong et al., 2017).\n\n\u2022 Specialized Datasets: Some approaches use task-specific datasets for pre-training. For example, ToTTo, a well-labeled dataset for table-to-text generation, is used by models like StruG  (6, Zhou et al., 2022).\n\n\u2022 Large-scale Collections: Researchers often compile large collections of tabular datasets. Liu et al. collected and filtered 450 publicly available tabular datasets for pre-training TAPTAP  (8, Liu et al., 2023). Similarly, Babenko et al. evaluated pre-training methods on a curated set of eleven middle to large-scale datasets  (44, Babenko et al., 2022).\n\n\u2022 Custom Datasets: Some researchers create their own datasets for pre-training. For instance, Huang et al. created ComplexTable, consisting of 1,000K samples  (88, Huang et al., 2023).\n\n\u2022 Multi-source Datasets: Pre-training often involves combining multiple data sources. Zheng et al. use large-scale table collections such as PubTables1M, Tablebank, and other small-scale table datasets for pre-training LORE++  (116, Zheng et al., 2024).\n\n\u2022 Domain-specific Datasets: Some approaches focus on specific domains. For example, Groth et al. suggest that table understanding models should be pre-trained on corpora that match relevant data distributions  (35, Groth et al., 2021).\n\nThe diversity and scale of these datasets aim to improve model performance across various table-related tasks and domains.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Table understanding models should reflect such data distributions and be pretrained on matching corpora and relevant labels.\n\n\n\nPre-training Methods and Objectives\nTLDR: Pre-training methods for table-specific models often involve adapting language model techniques to tabular data structures. Common objectives include masked language modeling, query execution prediction, and contrastive learning, with a focus on capturing table-specific relationships and semantics.\n\nPre-training methods for table-specific tasks have evolved to leverage the unique structure and content of tabular data. Many approaches adapt techniques from language model pre-training, while others introduce novel objectives tailored to tabular data.\n\nA common strategy is to extend masked language modeling to tabular contexts. TaBERT and TaPas, for instance, concatenate tabular data with associated text and apply BERT's masked language modeling objective  (3, Manjunatha et al., 2021). This approach allows models to learn joint representations of tables and text.\n\nSeveral models focus on SQL query execution as a pre-training task. TAPEX synthesizes a large-scale corpus of SQL queries and their execution results, pre-training the model to output these results  (2, Lou et al., 2021)  (5, Guo et al., 2021). Similarly, POET-SQL pre-trains on a query result selection task, allowing encoder-only language models to benefit from SQL execution  (43, Lin et al., 2022).\n\nNovel objectives specific to tabular data have also been introduced. FORTAP leverages spreadsheet formulas for pre-training, using objectives like numerical reference prediction and numerical calculation prediction  (4, Dong et al., 2021). Vertical-Partition Contrastive Learning (VPCL) enables pre-training on multiple tables and facilitates fine-tuning on target datasets  (42, Sun et al., 2022).\n\nSome approaches use a combination of pre-training objectives. For example, GetPt employs three pre-training objectives to learn better table representations  (95, Jin et al., 2023). Others, like STRUG, use large fine-grained labeled datasets such as ToTTo for pre-training  (6, Zhou et al., 2022)  (17, Awadallah et al., 2020).\n\nRecent trends include exploring federated learning for pre-training on diverse tabular datasets  (7, Erickson et al., 2023) and adapting data augmentation techniques like Mixup and CutMix to tabular data pre-training  (70, Chen et al., 2023).\n\nOverall, pre-training methods for table-specific tasks aim to capture the unique structure and relationships within tabular data while leveraging advances in language model pre-training. The diversity of approaches reflects the ongoing research to find optimal strategies for learning table representations and improving performance on downstream tasks.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These architectures range from simple flattening approaches to more complex designs that incorporate table-specific encodings and hierarchical structures.\n\nTable pre-training architectures have evolved significantly to better capture the unique characteristics of tabular data. Many approaches build upon transformer-based language models, adapting them to handle the structured nature of tables.\n\nOne common approach is to flatten tables into sequences and use traditional language model architectures. TaBERT, for instance, concatenates tabular data with associated text and applies BERT's masked language modeling objective for pre-training  (15, Yin et al., 2020). Similarly, TaPas extends BERT to jointly learn representations for sentences and tables  (3, Manjunatha et al., 2021).\n\nMore sophisticated architectures have been developed to better capture table structure. TUTA pre-trains on general tables with hierarchies to model table structural information  (34, Dong et al., 2021). TABBIE furthers the design of TaBERT by using two independent transformers to encode the rows and columns of tables jointly  (81, Chen et al., 2023).\n\nSome models focus on specific table-related tasks. TAPEX, for example, uses an encoder-decoder architecture pre-trained on a large synthetic SQL dataset to perform as a SQL executor  (110, Li et al., 2024). REalTabFormer employs an autoregressive (GPT-2) transformer to model non-relational tabular data for generating parent tables  (69, Dupriez et al., 2023).\n\nRecent trends include adapting pre-trained language models for tabular data. TURL further pre-trains a pre-trained language model using table data to make it more suitable for tabular tasks  (27, Chen et al., 2021). Some approaches, like XTab and ORCA, focus on transferring large-scale pre-trained transformers for tabular data  (74, Zhou et al., 2023).\n\nResearchers are also exploring architectures that can handle diverse table collections. Some models are designed to pre-train across tables that vary in the number and types of columns  (112, Wang et al., 2024). SHEETPT refines model architecture and pre-training tasks specifically for spreadsheets  (89, Du et al., 2023).\n\nThe diversity of architectures reflects ongoing efforts to find optimal ways to represent and learn from tabular data. While many build on existing language model architectures, there's a clear trend towards developing table-specific structures and pre-training objectives to better capture the unique properties of tabular data.\n\nReferences:\n1.

SHEETPT refers to the design of table pre-training approaches and refining the model architecture and pre-training tasks with regard to the particularity of spreadsheets.\n\n\n\nDownstream Tasks and Fine-tuning\nTLDR: Pre-trained table models are applied to a diverse range of downstream tasks, including question answering, semantic parsing, and classification. Fine-tuning strategies often involve task-specific adaptations and demonstrate significant performance improvements over non-pre-trained baselines.\n\nPre-trained table models have shown remarkable versatility and effectiveness when fine-tuned for various downstream tasks. These tasks span a wide range of applications, from natural language interactions with tabular data to complex reasoning and generation tasks.\n\nQuestion answering over tables is a prominent downstream task. Models like TaBERT and TaPas have achieved state-of-the-art results on benchmarks such as WikiTableQuestions when fine-tuned for this task  (15, Yin et al., 2020). Similarly, TAPEX, which is pre-trained on SQL execution, has shown strong performance on table-based question answering tasks after fine-tuning  (48, Zhang et al., 2022).\n\nSemantic parsing, particularly text-to-SQL tasks, is another important application. Models like STRUG have outperformed existing baselines on realistic text-to-SQL datasets after fine-tuning  (17, Awadallah et al., 2020). Some approaches, like the one proposed by Rijke et al., use ground-truth SQL queries from datasets like Spider for pre-training, which aids in downstream performance on multi-table reasoning tasks  (79, Rijke et al., 2023).\n\nClassification tasks, especially in healthcare domains, have also benefited from table pre-training. TabRet, for instance, achieved the best AUC performance on four healthcare datasets after being pre-trained on public health surveys and fine-tuned for classification  (10, Oono et al., 2023).\n\nOther downstream tasks include cell type classification, formula prediction, and faithful text generation  (89, Du et al., 2023). Some models, like TURL, have been fine-tuned and evaluated on multiple tasks for table understanding and augmentation  (115, Koleva et al., 2024).\n\nFine-tuning strategies often involve task-specific adaptations. For instance, TabPTM represents instances through their distance to a fixed number of prototypes, which helps standardize heterogeneous tabular datasets and enables promising performance even in few-shot scenarios  (11, Zhou et al., 2023). Some approaches explore few-shot learning by fine-tuning pre-trained tabular models on new datasets with limited samples  (75, Wang et al., 2023).\n\nComparative studies have highlighted the effectiveness of table pre-training methods across different tasks. Zhao et al. implemented and compared six table pre-training models on various datasets, including question answering, fact checking, and text generation tasks  (82, Zhao et al., 2023). These studies consistently show that pre-trained models outperform non-pre-trained baselines, often by significant margins  (16, Huang et al., 2020).\n\nThe diversity of downstream tasks and the consistent performance improvements demonstrate the value of table pre-training in enhancing model capabilities for tabular data understanding and manipulation across various domains and applications.\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "e894bc20daf0522da9c576ae27b257de", "answer_text": "Structural challenges\nTLDR: Adapting transformer models for tabular data faces challenges due to the unique structural properties of tables, including row-column permutation invariance and hierarchical organization. These differences from unstructured text require modifications to standard transformer architectures.\n\nTransformer models, originally designed for unstructured text, face several structural challenges when adapted for tabular data representation. One of the primary issues is that tables are inherently different from free-form text in their organization and semantic structure  (1, Fainman et al., 2023). Unlike text, tables are largely invariant to row and column permutations, meaning that swapping rows or columns typically does not alter the table's overall meaning  (1, Fainman et al., 2023)  (34, Huang et al., 2023). This property poses a challenge for standard transformer models, which are designed to process sequential information.\n\nAnother significant challenge is the need to model the row-column structure of tables, which is crucial for correctly interpreting relational data  (8, Yu et al., 2020). The hierarchical nature of tabular data, with its complex relationships between headers, rows, and cells, is not naturally captured by the sequential processing of traditional transformers  (34, Huang et al., 2023).\n\nTo address these issues, researchers have found it necessary to extend and modify the typical transformer architecture  (32, Saeed et al., 2023). These adaptations aim to account for the richer and more structured nature of tabular data compared to free text. However, the fundamental structural differences between textual and tabular data make it challenging to use existing learning models without significant modifications  (16, Bedathur et al., 2021).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(1, Fainman et al., 2023) | n_citations: 26 | Table-GPT: Table-tuned GPT for Diverse Table Tasks ]: \ntables are largely \"invariant\" to row and column permutations, where swapping two rows or columns do not generally change the semantic meaning of the table... We can see that it is clearly challenging for language models to read tables in the column direction... All of these make tables different from texts, likely rendering languagemodels sub-optimal for table use cases\n\n2. [(34, Huang et al., 2023) | n_citations: 9 | HYTREL: Hypergraph-enhanced Tabular Data Representation Learning ]: \nLanguage models pretrained on large collections of tabular data have demonstrated their effectiveness in several downstream tasks. However, many of these models do not take into account the row/column permutation invariances, hierarchical structure, etc. that exist in tabular data.\n\n3. [(8, Yu et al., 2020) | n_citations: 3 | TURL ]: \nHowever, Transformer is originally designed for unstructured text sequences and cannot model the row-column structure, which is important for interpreting relational tables.\n\n4. [(32, Saeed et al., 2023) | n_citations: 33 | Transformers for Tabular Data Representation: A Survey of Models and Applications ]: \nExtensions on the typical transformer architecture are applied to account for the tabular structure, which is different and richer in some aspects than traditional free text.\n\n5. [(16, Bedathur et al., 2021) | n_citations: 2 | BERT Meets Relational DB: Contextual Representations of Relational Databases ]: \nThe structural difference between the textual and tabular data makes it hard to use the existing learning models out of the box.\n\n\n\nData representation issues\nTLDR: Adapting transformer models for tabular data faces challenges in effectively representing the unique structure and content of tables. These issues include handling numerical values, preserving table structure, and dealing with context window limitations.\n\nTransforming tabular data into a format suitable for transformer models presents several significant challenges. One of the primary issues is the loss of structural information when converting tables into linear sequences. This linearization process often results in the loss of valuable two-dimensional contextual information inherent to structured data  (51, Gubanov et al., 2023). The problem is compounded by the fact that many methods naively treat table tuples as sentences, further diminishing the rich relational context present in tabular formats  (51, Gubanov et al., 2023).\n\nAnother crucial challenge lies in the representation of numerical values. Some approaches, such as GReaT and TapTap, fine-tuned models like GPT-2 on templated table texts, treating numerical values as strings. This approach led to insensitivity to these values, potentially compromising the model's ability to perform numerical reasoning or comparisons  (3, Zheng et al., 2024).\n\nThe context window limitation of transformer models poses an additional hurdle. Large tables often exceed the token length capacity of these models, making it difficult for them to comprehend global tabular information  (33, Chen et al., 2023). This limitation is exacerbated when attempting to represent all table information in a linear sequence, resulting in verbose representations that frequently surpass the context window limits of popular transformer models  (43, Agirre et al., 2023).\n\nThe sensitivity of transformer models to input formats presents yet another challenge. Research has shown that the performance of large language models (LLMs) can vary significantly depending on how tabular data is converted into text format  (54, Socolinsky et al., 2024)  (53, Nikolic et al., 2023). This sensitivity highlights the need for careful consideration of serialization methods when adapting these models for tabular data tasks.\n\nFurthermore, existing approaches often overlook the distinctions between dynamic and static fields in sequential tabular data. By replicating and filling static fields into each record, these methods introduce computational overhead and may yield less meaningful representations. Additionally, they often disregard temporal information between rows, potentially missing important behavioral patterns implied by time intervals  (2, Dai et al., 2023).\n\nThe linearization process can also impair the model's ability to recognize table structures accurately. This limitation becomes particularly evident when dealing with tables containing repetitive or similar data cells, leading to errors in tasks such as table transposition  (42, Chen et al., 2023).\n\nLastly, there are ongoing challenges in accurately representing numeric tables and tables without descriptive headers  (37, Hulsebos et al., 2023). These issues underscore the need for more sophisticated approaches to data representation that can capture the nuances of various tabular formats and content types.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(51, Gubanov et al., 2023) | n_citations: 0 | Learning Circular Tabular Embeddings for Heterogeneous Large-scale Structured Datasets ]: \nSome methods directly use the embeddings, pre-trained on large corpora, such as Wikipedia and naively treat table tuples as sentences, when it comes to structured data...

[(37, Hulsebos et al., 2023) | n_citations: 2 | Models and Practice of Neural Table Representations ]: \nWe will also explore a few general challenges of LM-based transformers for tabular data such as accurately representing numeric tables and tables without descriptive headers.\n\n\n\nPerformance limitations\nTLDR: Transformer models face significant performance challenges when applied to tabular data, including difficulties in handling table structures, limitations in task generalization, and issues with data representation. These challenges highlight the need for specialized adaptations and improvements to enhance transformer models' effectiveness for tabular tasks.\n\nTransformer models, despite their success in natural language processing, encounter several performance limitations when adapted for tabular data representation and analysis. One of the primary challenges is the models' struggle to effectively handle the unique structure of tables. Traditional transformer architectures, designed for unstructured text, often underperform when dealing with tables without associated text, as they fail to fully capture the tabular structure  (10, Manjunatha et al., 2021). This limitation becomes more pronounced when dealing with irregular table structures containing segments and subtables, leading to weaker overall performance  (17, Chen, 2022).\n\nThe application of transformer architectures to tabular data remains limited, particularly in tasks such as standard classification and regression with text and tabular features  (13, Mueller et al., 2021). This limitation is partly due to the models' lack of ability to understand tables inherently  (22, Kertkeidkachorn et al., 2022). Pre-training on unstructured data further exacerbates this issue when the models are applied to structured tabular data  (14, Smith et al., 2021).\n\nAnother significant challenge is the models' struggle to generalize across various table-related tasks. While some transformer-based models have shown promise in specific areas like table question answering and fact verification, they often lack the versatility to handle a broader range of table tasks effectively  (55, Chen et al., 2024). This limitation is particularly evident in domains requiring specialized knowledge, such as medical tabular data prediction, where issues like under-utilization of unstructured free-text and limited exploration of textual information in structured data persist  (41, Lan et al., 2023).\n\nThe hierarchical structure and long-tailed nature of tables also pose challenges for language models, limiting their performance in tasks that require reasoning over semi-structured tables  (29, Goyal et al., 2022). To address these issues, researchers have explored various adaptations, such as modifying attention mechanisms to better align with tabular data or designing hierarchical encoding to capture table structure  (56, Peter et al., 2024). However, these adaptations often require significant modifications to the standard transformer architecture.\n\nIn scenarios with limited labeled data, such as in highly technical domains like spreadsheets, fine-tuning transformer-based models becomes particularly challenging  (24, Buckley et al., 2022). This highlights the need for specialized approaches that can leverage the tabular inductive bias to improve model convergence and performance in low-resource settings.\n\nOverall, while transformer models have shown potential in certain tabular data tasks, their performance limitations underscore the need for continued research and development of specialized architectures and training approaches tailored to the unique challenges posed by tabular data representation and analysis.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(10, Manjunatha et al., 2021) | n_citations: 125 | TABBIE: Pretrained Representations of Tabular Data ]: \nExisting table representation models such as TaBERT (Yin et al., 2020) and TaPas (Herzig et al., 2020) concatenate tabular data with an associated piece of text and then use BERT's masked language modeling objective for pretraining... While this joint pretraining improves tasks involving paired tables and text (e.g., answering questions about tables), we show that it underperforms on tasks that operate over tables without any associated text (e.g., populating missing cells).\n\n2. [(17, Chen, 2022) | n_citations: 84 | Large Language Models are few(1)-shot Table Reasoners ]: \nCompared to TabFact, the model's overall performance is weaker mainly because the table structure in FEVEROUS is more irregular, containing lots of segments and subtables.\n\n3.

[(29, Goyal et al., 2022) | n_citations: 0 | Text Generation for Populating Semi-structured Tables ]: \nWhile most of the tasks that reason over semi-structured tables utilize the transformer-based sequence-to-sequence models, the table's hierarchical structure and long-tailed nature seem to limit the performance of language models.\n\n9.

We show that this boosts performance in our low-resource scenario considerably... Our experiments confirm that a table transformer outperforms other baselines and that its tabular inductive bias is vital for convergence of transformer-based models.\n\n\n\nComputational constraints\nTLDR: Adapting transformer models for tabular data faces significant computational challenges, primarily due to input size limitations and processing complexity. These constraints become particularly acute when dealing with large tables or high-dimensional data, necessitating efficient preprocessing and novel architectural solutions.\n\nTransformer-based models, while powerful for many natural language processing tasks, encounter substantial computational constraints when applied to tabular data representation. One of the primary challenges is the limitation on the maximum size of input text that these models can process  (20, Oliveira et al., 2022). This constraint becomes particularly problematic when dealing with large tables, as serializing such data often results in sequences that exceed the processing capacity of classical transformer-based models  (45, Chen et al., 2023).\n\nThe computational complexity of transformer models poses another significant hurdle. The quadratic relationship between input sequence length and computational requirements means that processing large tables can lead to prohibitively long run-times, especially when dealing with substantial volumes of data  (20, Oliveira et al., 2022). This issue is exacerbated in scenarios where table data is exceptionally large, potentially rendering the model incapable of encoding the complete dataset  (9, Bagwe et al., 2020).\n\nFurthermore, the high-dimensional nature of many tabular datasets presents additional computational challenges. Efficient pre-processing of categorical and numerical features becomes crucial to manage the computational load effectively  (44, Arora et al., 2023). These preprocessing steps, while necessary, add to the overall computational requirements of adapting transformer models for tabular data tasks.\n\nTo address these computational constraints, researchers and practitioners must explore innovative approaches. These may include developing more efficient encoding techniques, designing specialized architectures that can handle larger input sizes, or implementing novel preprocessing strategies to reduce the dimensional complexity of tabular data while preserving its essential characteristics [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. As the field progresses, finding solutions to these computational challenges will be crucial for the widespread adoption of transformer-based models in tabular data applications.\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "e551f57061ffdacce638393c2984010b", "answer_text": "Reactive Methods for Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance\nTLDR: Reactive methods enable real-time navigation in dynamic environments by making quick decisions based on current sensor data. Popular approaches include artificial potential fields, dynamic window approaches, and velocity obstacle methods.\n\nReactive methods are crucial for safe navigation in partially observable environments with moving obstacles, as they allow robots to respond quickly to changes in their surroundings. These techniques prioritize real-time decision-making based on current sensor information, making them well-suited for dynamic and unknown environments  (9, Khatib et al., 1999).\n\nOne widely used reactive approach is the Artificial Potential Field (APF) method. An improved version of APF has been proposed for obstacle avoidance in unstructured environments, incorporating relative velocity and acceleration functions to enhance the smoothness of lane-changing paths  (418, Wang et al., 2024).\n\nThe Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) is another notable reactive method that searches for admissible controls directly in the linear and angular velocity space (48, Martinez-Gomez, 2010). An extension of this concept, the Forbidden Velocity Map, generalizes the Dynamic Window to consider obstacle and robot shape, velocity, and dynamics, resulting in a safe, real-time navigation algorithm for unpredictable and cluttered scenarios  (41, Damas et al., 2009).\n\nVelocity Obstacles (VO) and its variants, such as Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO) and Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA), form another family of effective reactive methods for dynamic environments (48, Martinez-Gomez, 2010)  (380, Liu et al., 2023). These approaches achieve navigation by deciding the next action through different planning strategies based on the perceived external information at each moment.\n\nRecent advancements have led to the development of hybrid approaches that combine multiple reactive methods. For instance, the A* fusion DWA algorithm has shown promise in achieving dynamic obstacle avoidance in environments with both static and moving obstacles  (358, Shi et al., 2023).\n\nWhile reactive methods excel in responding to immediate threats, they may struggle with long-term planning and global optimality. To address this limitation, some researchers have proposed combining reactive techniques with predictive and planning-based approaches to create more robust navigation systems  (9, Khatib et al., 1999)  (172, Aradi, 2020).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(9, Khatib et al., 1999) | n_citations: 601 | High-speed navigation using the global dynamic window approach ]: \nPlanning approaches are well suited for achieving a goal position in known static environments, while real-time obstacle avoidance methods allow reactive motion behavior in dynamic and unknown environments... combines methods from motion planning and real-time obstacle avoidance to result in a framework that allows robust execution of high-velocity, goal-directed reactive motion for a mobile robot in unknown and dynamic environments.\n\n2.

These methods include sampling-based techniques, model predictive control, and trajectory optimization, which can handle complex environments and moving obstacles.\n\nPredictive and planning-based approaches offer more sophisticated solutions for safe navigation in partially observable environments with moving obstacles. These methods aim to anticipate future states of the environment and plan optimal trajectories accordingly, often providing better long-term performance compared to purely reactive techniques.\n\nSampling-based motion planning algorithms have made significant progress in efficiently finding trajectories for high-dimensional and nonlinear systems. Examples include Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM), Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), and their variants  (26, Kavraki et al., 2007). These methods can be adapted for dynamic environments, with algorithms like RRT*-FDWA proposed to address the challenges of path planning and obstacle avoidance in uncertain, dynamic settings  (349, Zhou et al., 2023).\n\nModel Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful framework for navigation in dynamic environments. Chance-constrained MPC (CC-MPC) has been used to ensure robust collision avoidance for micro aerial vehicles by formulating the problem to keep collision probabilities below specified thresholds (176, Alonso-Mora et al., 2020). Another approach, SICNav, uses MPC to jointly solve for robot motion and predicted crowd motion in closed-loop, allowing for influence on pedestrian movement while maintaining safety constraints  (382, Samavi et al., 2023).\n\nTrajectory optimization methods have also been developed to handle dynamic obstacle avoidance. These approaches consider the entire volume of obstacles across prediction time steps, although this can sometimes result in conservative trajectories  (343, Li et al., 2023). To address this, some researchers have proposed novel trajectory cost formulations that reduce conservative behaviors and generate smoother paths  (356, Park et al., 2023).\n\nPrediction of pedestrian movements plays a crucial role in many planning-based approaches. Methods like the Social Force Model (SFM), Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO), and Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) provide foundational frameworks for anticipating human motion  (4, Dong et al., 2024). More advanced techniques, such as autoregressive Gaussian process motion models (AR-GPMM), have been used to predict pedestrian trajectories from a robot's partially-observable egocentric view  (82, Kim et al., 2014).\n\nIntegrating prediction with planning, some researchers have proposed methods that simulate future states considering the effects of robot actions on pedestrian intentions. For example, a global planner using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) has been developed to estimate the quality of local goals while accounting for human-robot interaction  (350, Oh et al., 2023).\n\nHybrid approaches that combine multiple techniques have shown promise in addressing the complexities of dynamic environments. For instance, algorithms combining probabilistic roadmaps with D*Lite have been proposed for safe navigation in obstacle-rich settings, although they may not always yield the optimal path  (364, Wei et al., 2023).\n\nWhile predictive and planning-based approaches offer advantages in terms of global optimality and long-term planning, they often require more computational resources compared to reactive methods. As such, ongoing research focuses on improving the efficiency and real-time performance of these techniques to make them more suitable for highly dynamic and partially observable environments.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This method reduces planning time but does not yield the optimal path.\n\n\n\nLearning-based Navigation Techniques\nTLDR: Learning-based approaches, particularly deep reinforcement learning (DRL), have emerged as powerful tools for navigation in dynamic environments. These methods can learn complex behaviors for obstacle avoidance and path planning, often outperforming traditional approaches in crowded and unpredictable scenarios.\n\nDeep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a prominent approach for tackling the challenges of safe navigation in partially observable environments with moving obstacles. DRL-based methods have shown remarkable capabilities in learning complex behaviors for collision avoidance and path planning, often surpassing traditional techniques in crowded and dynamic scenarios  (180, Patel et al., 2020)  (419, Gregory et al., 2024).\n\nOne of the key advantages of learning-based approaches is their ability to model the relationships between the robot, static obstacles, and moving pedestrians. For instance, Li et al. proposed a novel DRL architecture that combines spatial graph and attention reasoning to enhance navigation in environments with limited sensor range  (2, Li et al., 2022). Similarly, Xie et al. developed a learning-based control policy that uses a unique combination of lidar data, pedestrian kinematics, and subgoal information to generate steering angles and forward velocities, demonstrating strong generalizability to new environments  (339, Xie et al., 2023).\n\nSeveral researchers have focused on integrating DRL with other techniques to improve navigation performance. Riazuelo et al. combined a dynamic window approach with DRL, defining a reward function that encourages velocities moving away from obstacles  (3, Riazuelo et al., 2022). Sunilkumar et al. proposed a Nonlinear Model Predictive control-based RL framework for obstacle avoidance  (423, Sunilkumar et al., 2024).\n\nLearning-based methods have also shown promise in predicting obstacle motions and planning corresponding avoidance actions. Hu et al. developed a motion-prediction-based obstacle avoidance method using DRL, which constructs motion trend vectors to express the movement patterns of dynamic obstacles  (326, Hu et al., 2022). Garg et al. demonstrated that deep RL can be used to simultaneously predict obstacle motions and determine avoidance actions through trial-and-error learning  (159, Garg et al., 2019).\n\nTo improve the performance of DRL algorithms in dynamic environments, researchers have explored various enhancements. Min et al. proposed a PL-TD3-based path planning algorithm that combines the TD3 algorithm with LSTM units and a Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) strategy to improve convergence speed and perception of dynamic obstacles  (327, Min et al., 2022). Zhou et al. introduced the R-SARL framework, which augments the reward function to avoid collisions by estimating unsafe interactions between the robot and obstacles within a look-ahead distance  (254, Zhou et al., 2021).\n\nOne of the advantages of learning-based approaches is their potential for transfer learning. Lee et al. demonstrated a goal-oriented obstacle avoidance system based on DRL that uses depth information and goal positions as inputs. Their model, trained in simulation, could be directly transferred to other environments and was capable of avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles  (183, Lee et al., 2020).\n\nLearning-based navigation techniques have also been successfully applied to specific robotic systems. Guo et al. adopted a DRL algorithm to solve autonomous navigation and real-time obstacle avoidance for robot manipulators in dynamic obstacle environments  (344, Guo et al., 2023). In crowded scenarios, approaches like CrowdMove have been deployed for robotic navigation among dense groups of people  (177, Manocha et al., 2020).\n\nWhile learning-based navigation techniques have shown great promise, it's important to note that they often require significant computational resources and training data. Ongoing research focuses on improving the efficiency, generalizability, and real-time performance of these methods to make them more suitable for deployment in real-world, partially observable environments with moving obstacles [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods often integrate global planning with local reactive behaviors, enabling robots to navigate efficiently in complex, dynamic environments.\n\nHybrid and integrated approaches have emerged as powerful solutions for safe navigation in partially observable environments with moving obstacles. These methods combine different navigation techniques to capitalize on their respective strengths while mitigating their weaknesses.\n\nOne promising hybrid approach integrates global path planning with local obstacle avoidance. Song et al. proposed a method that combines the Artificial Potential Field (APF) and Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms for robotic manipulator path planning  (345, Song et al., 2023). This approach generates an initial static path and then uses real-time tracking of both static and dynamic obstacles to enable fast local re-planning, effectively balancing global efficiency with local responsiveness.\n\nAnother innovative hybrid method draws inspiration from natural systems. Wang et al. developed a distributed cooperative control algorithm that mimics the obstacle avoidance behavior of pigeons  (348, Wang et al., 2023). This approach incorporates an obstacle detection mechanism and a velocity adjustment mechanism, along with a collision avoidance system inspired by spring damping systems. By combining these biologically-inspired elements, the algorithm achieves safe flight and formation reconfiguration in dynamic environments.\n\nIntegrating learning-based approaches with traditional navigation methods has also shown promise. Hossain et al. combined the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance navigation in environments with mobile obstacles  (351, Hossain et al., 2023). This integration allows the robot to develop improved spatial awareness of moving obstacles through a carefully designed reward function, potentially leading to more effective obstacle avoidance behaviors.\n\nSome hybrid approaches focus on combining global and local planning strategies. Mendil et al. proposed a method that uses a global approach for motion along a desired path, employing 2nd order polynomial planning, while utilizing a local reactive approach based on neural control for collision avoidance with both static and dynamic obstacles  (97, Mendil et al., 2015). This approach was further extended to handle moving targets, demonstrating its flexibility in dealing with various dynamic scenarios.\n\nThese hybrid and integrated approaches showcase the potential for combining different navigation techniques to create more robust and adaptable systems. By leveraging the strengths of multiple methods, robots can better handle the complexities of partially observable environments with moving obstacles, achieving a balance between global efficiency and local responsiveness.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The proposed approach is extended to include the problem of moving target.\n\n\n\nConsiderations for Partially Observable Environments\nTLDR: Partially observable environments present unique challenges for safe navigation, requiring algorithms that can handle uncertainty and incomplete information. Approaches like extended RRTs, Bayesian learning, and biologically-inspired methods have been developed to address these challenges.\n\nIn partially observable environments, robots must navigate safely with limited or uncertain information about their surroundings. This scenario presents unique challenges that require specialized approaches to ensure effective and safe navigation.\n\nOne notable method for handling uncertainty in partially observable environments is the extension of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm. Ishigami et al. proposed modifications to RRT that explicitly consider robot mobility and parameter uncertainty using the stochastic response surface method (SRSM)  (40, Ishigami et al., 2009). This approach has shown promise in generating safe paths on uncertain, uneven terrain, demonstrating its potential for navigation in complex, partially observable environments.\n\nSampling-based methods, such as Probabilistic Roadmap Methods (PRM) and RRT, have been widely used for path planning in cluttered environments with obstacles  (114, Bestaoui et al., 2017). These techniques are particularly useful for nonholonomic vehicles, as they can efficiently explore the configuration space and find collision-free trajectories even with limited environmental information.\n\nTo address the social aspects of navigation in partially observable environments with pedestrians, Randhavane et al. developed SocioSense, a real-time algorithm for socially-aware robot navigation  (113, Randhavane et al., 2017). This approach uses Bayesian learning and Personality Trait theory to compute time-varying behaviors of pedestrians, combining psychological and social constraints to enable human-aware navigation in low- to medium-density crowds.\n\nLocal path planning plays a crucial role in adapting to partially observable environments. Li et al. emphasize the importance of real-time decision-making based on the surrounding environment to achieve autonomous obstacle avoidance and improve environmental adaptability  (275, Li et al., 2022). This highlights the need for algorithms that can quickly process available information and make informed decisions in dynamic, partially observable scenarios.\n\nBiologically-inspired approaches have also shown promise in navigating uncertain dynamic environments. Wang proposed several algorithms, including the biologically-inspired navigation algorithm (BINA) and the equidistant based navigation algorithm (ENA), which are efficient in terms of avoidance time and can navigate through uncertain dynamic environments  (91, Wang, 2014). These methods demonstrate the potential of mimicking natural behaviors to achieve safe navigation in complex, partially observable settings.\n\nIn summary, addressing the challenges of partially observable environments requires a combination of techniques that can handle uncertainty, adapt to dynamic conditions, and make efficient use of limited information. From extended sampling-based methods to socially-aware algorithms and biologically-inspired approaches, researchers continue to develop innovative solutions to enhance safe navigation in these complex scenarios.\n\nReferences:\n1.

They can get stuck in local solutions, potentially missing optimal paths through tight spaces.\n\nThe Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is a powerful tool for path planning, particularly in high-dimensional and constrained spaces  (12, Kirillova et al., 2007). Its strengths lie in its ability to quickly explore entire environments, generate sub-optimal paths, and handle complex constraints without modeling the entire space  (100, Tian et al., 2022)  (8, Huang et al., 2022). RRT-based methods are computationally efficient for offline path generation and offer probabilistic completeness  (68, Cheng et al., 2020).\n\nHowever, when confronted with narrow passages, RRT algorithms face significant challenges. The primary issue is that they can easily become limited to local solutions, struggling to find paths through tight spaces  (8, Huang et al., 2022). This limitation is particularly problematic for applications like microrobot navigation, where the ability to traverse narrow passages is crucial. The random sampling approach that makes RRT effective in open spaces can become a hindrance in tightly constrained environments, potentially missing optimal or even feasible paths through these critical areas [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nTo effectively adapt RRT-based path planning for narrow pathways, strategies must be developed to overcome these local minima and improve exploration in constrained spaces. This challenge sets the stage for various modifications and enhancements to the basic RRT algorithm, which will be explored in the following sections.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods include obstacle-aware sampling, adaptive partitioning, and informed set pruning to enhance efficiency in constrained spaces.\n\nTo address the challenges of RRT-based path planning in narrow passages, researchers have developed various sampling strategies that aim to improve the algorithm's performance in constrained environments. One notable approach is the use of obstacle-aware sampling techniques. Lien et al. proposed a variant of RRT that incorporates multiple growth strategies, taking into account obstacles in the environment to more effectively explore narrow passages  (1, Lien et al., 2006). Similarly, Ferizbegovic et al. introduced an algorithm that uses dominant eigenvectors of configuration sets formed by sampling around the nearest node, enabling efficient tree expansion around obstacles and through narrow passages in a vine-like manner  (5, Ferizbegovic et al., 2018).\n\nAnother effective approach is the use of non-uniform sampling methods. Meng et al. embedded obstacle-based Gaussian sampling within uniform sampling to increase sample density in difficult-to-sample homotopy classes, improving planning efficiency in cluttered environments with narrow passages  (45, Meng et al., 2017). Gupta et al. proposed a novel non-uniform partitioning scheme that divides the area into obstacle-free convex cells, resulting in larger cells in open areas and smaller cells in obstacle-dense regions, which was then incorporated into the RRT* path planner  (91, Gupta et al., 2021).\n\nTo further enhance efficiency, some researchers have focused on reducing the sampling domain. Wu et al. discussed sampling domain reduction methods used in RRT*-smart, DDRRT, and IRRT* to improve RRT efficiency  (63, Wu et al., 2020). Choudhury et al. introduced the concept of the Informed Set, which conservatively prunes the configuration space to eliminate points that cannot yield shorter paths, while retaining asymptotic optimality  (82, Choudhury et al., 2021).\n\nLastly, the incorporation of heuristics into sampling strategies has shown promise. Merino et al. proposed a framework that allows for the integration of arbitrary heuristics to modify the sampling strategy according to user requirements, improving performance in terms of cost and time to find the first path, as well as the evolution of path quality with iterations  (33, Merino et al., 2016).\n\nThese advanced sampling strategies collectively aim to overcome the limitations of traditional RRT algorithms in narrow passages by focusing exploration on critical areas, adapting to the environment's geometry, and incorporating problem-specific knowledge to guide the search process more effectively.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Densification via sampling from this Informed Set retains asymptotic optimality of sampling from the entire configuration space.\n\n7. [(33, Merino et al., 2016) | n_citations: 13 | Planning with ants ]: \nThese methods perform a uniform sampling of the state space, which is needed to guarantee the algorithm's completeness but does not necessarily lead to the most efficient solution... Here we propose a framework that allows us to incorporate arbitrary heuristics to modify the sampling strategy according to the user requirements... We evaluate its performance in terms of the cost and time to find the first path, and in terms of the evolution of the path quality with the number of iterations.\n\n\n\nGuiding and Biasing Techniques\nTLDR: Guiding and biasing techniques for RRT algorithms enhance path planning in narrow passages by incorporating additional information or heuristics. These methods include guided sampling, local steering, and the use of artificial waypoints or learned models to improve exploration efficiency.\n\nTo improve RRT performance in narrow passages, researchers have developed various guiding and biasing techniques. One approach is to use guiding paths to focus sampling. Von\u00b4asek et al. proposed an iterative scaling approach that preferentially samples along a given guiding path, significantly increasing the success rate of finding feasible paths in high-dimensional configuration spaces compared to standard RRT algorithms (3, Von\u00b4asek et al., 2011).\n\nLocal guidance strategies have also shown promise. Zhou et al. introduced the Locally Guided Multiple Bi-RRT\u2217 (LGM-BRRT\u2217) method, which incorporates an improved bridge-test and a novel search strategy based on local guidance, resulting in faster solutions and more efficient memory utilization  (6, Zhou et al., 2019). Similarly, Koditschek et al. proposed a sensory steering algorithm that can \"feel\" the configuration space locally, significantly improving path planning performance near difficult regions like narrow passages  (44, Koditschek et al., 2017).\n\nFor constrained spaces, Kim et al. generalized the RRT algorithm to constraint manifolds by approximating them as collections of tangent spaces, preserving the key features of RRT-based planning while adapting to complex constraints  (21, Kim et al., 2014).\n\nSeveral techniques focus on guiding RRT expansion more efficiently. Yung et al. introduced spatial skeleton extraction to calculate the skeleton of free space, combined with a greedy algorithm to increase RRT expansion and reduce unnecessary bends, resulting in faster search processes and shorter path lengths  (102, Yung et al., 2022). Zhao et al. proposed GMMM-RRTs, which use Gaussian Mixture Models learned from experiential paths to bias sampling, efficiently exploiting local space while maintaining global planning efficiency  (53, Zhao et al., 2018).\n\nArtificial guidance has also been explored to improve RRT performance in cluttered environments. Qua presented a hybrid strategy using artificial-guided points to create a multi-RRT structure, enabling quick identification of traversable areas through local exploration and merge features  (25, Qua, 2014). Similarly, Zhang et al. introduced artificial-guided RRTs (AG-RRTs) that use artificial-guided waypoints to mark narrow passage regions, improving the efficiency of connecting and merging multiple RRTs  (19, Zhang et al., 2013).\n\nThese guiding and biasing techniques collectively aim to overcome the limitations of traditional RRT algorithms in narrow passages by focusing exploration on critical areas, incorporating problem-specific knowledge, and adapting to complex environmental constraints.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(3, Von\u00b4asek et al., 2011) | n_citations: 16 | A Sampling Schema for Rapidly Exploring Random Trees using a Guiding Path ]: \nThe main idea of the proposed approach stands in a preference of the sampling of the configuration space C along a given guiding path instead of sampling of the whole space...

[(19, Zhang et al., 2013) | n_citations: 2 | A human-computer interaction based path planning method for Mobile Robots in a complex environment ]: \nAiming at the problem of efficiency reduction that original RRTs planners have difficulties in automatically finding a resolution path in crowded regions of the robot's configuration space, A novel artificial-guided RRTs (AG-RRTs) planner based on multiple RRTs will be introduced. The AG-RRTs planner improves the efficiency of connection and mergence of multiple RRTs by artificial-guided waypoints which mark the regions of narrow passages.\n\n\n\nHybrid and Multi-Stage Approaches\nTLDR: Hybrid and multi-stage approaches combine different algorithms or techniques to improve RRT performance in narrow passages. These methods often use a global planner for overall navigation and local planners or specialized techniques for handling constrained areas.\n\nHybrid and multi-stage approaches have emerged as effective solutions for adapting RRT-based path planning to efficiently handle narrow pathways. These methods typically combine the strengths of different algorithms or employ multiple stages to address the challenges posed by constrained environments.\n\nOne notable approach is the two-stage method proposed by Wang et al., which uses a Bridge Test sampling algorithm to identify critical regions in the first stage, followed by Triple-RRTs to search for local connections in the second stage  (2, Wang et al., 2010). This approach effectively addresses the problem of multi-d.o.f. robot path planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces with narrow corridors.\n\nLi et al. introduced a hierarchical trajectory planner specifically designed for environments with narrow passages  (76, Li et al., 2021). Their planner consists of a graph search layer using a multistage hybrid A* algorithm to handle narrow passages, combined with a numerical optimal control layer for refinement.\n\nTo improve RRT performance in dense environments and narrow passages, Chen et al. proposed three enhancements to RRT-based algorithms  (86, Chen et al., 2021). These improvements aim to increase efficiency, adaptability, and suitability for various challenging environments.\n\nZhang et al. developed a Hybrid Frontier Detection (HFD) strategy for autonomous exploration, which combines a variable step-size random tree global frontier detector, a multi-root nodes random tree frontier detector, and a grid-based frontier detector  (90, Zhang et al., 2021). This hybrid approach effectively addresses exploration in environments with multiple obstacles and narrow entrances.\n\nLiu et al. proposed the GSLST algorithm, which uses Connect-RRT for global sampling trees and combines Closed-Operation and Jump Point Search (JPS) to extract narrow paths and create Local Dynamic Link Trees  (70, Liu et al., 2020). This hybrid method leverages the speed of sampling-based algorithms in open spaces while maintaining the completeness of search-based algorithms in complex environments with narrow paths.\n\nWhile RRT algorithms are known for their ability to quickly find feasible paths in high-dimensional spaces, they may not always produce optimal solutions or consistent results for the same motion planning problem  (57, Paulo et al., 2019). Hybrid and multi-stage approaches aim to address these limitations by combining RRT's strengths with complementary techniques, particularly for handling narrow passages efficiently.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods include bidirectional approaches, local replanning, path smoothing, and integration with machine learning techniques.\n\n- Bidirectional RRT: To improve performance in cluttered environments and narrow passages, bidirectional approaches like Bidirectional-RRT* have been proposed (83, Al-Darraji et al., 2021). Yu et al. further enhanced this by fusing bidirectional RRT with rapidly exploring random vines, showing improved planning performance in narrow roads  (108, Yu et al., 2022).\n\n- Local Replanning: Dynamic RRT algorithms have been developed for local replanning, preserving original points as much as possible  (137, Zhang et al., 2023). This approach can replace global planning in certain scenarios, offering more adaptability.\n\n- Path Smoothing: The Smooth RRT (S-RRT) algorithm generates smooth, curved continuous executable paths for robot manipulators based on a path optimization strategy with maximum curvature constraints  (139, Huang et al., 2023).\n\n- Machine Learning Integration: Neural RRT* has been extended to 3D space for efficient path planning, improving performance in complex environments  (101, Jia et al., 2022). Additionally, reinforcement learning has been incorporated into RRT algorithms (LM-RRT) to solve path planning in narrow environments  (123, Liu et al., 2023).\n\n- Sparse Waypoint Optimization: The BPOMP (Boundary Point Optimization with Minimal Perturbation) approach works with sparsely spaced waypoints, finding and optimizing the closest positions to obstacles along continuous paths  (106, Sun et al., 2022).\n\n- Multi-Trajectory Optimization: MPOT (Motion Planning via Optimal Transport) performs well in narrow passages by independently updating each waypoint across all trajectories  (129, Le et al., 2023).\n\n- Improved Optimality: Techniques have been developed to improve the optimality of paths generated by multiple-RRT, addressing the issue of suboptimal routes in configuration space  (156, Lee et al., 2024).\n\n- Dynamic Constraints: NoD-RRT utilizes neural network-based cost functions and nonlinear robot dynamics to plan trajectories while considering key dynamical limits  (157, Epureanu et al., 2024).\n\n- Connectivity-Aware Planning: CAPER builds on RRT with algorithmic modifications in both the planner and collision detector to address challenges in connectivity-aware path planning in realistic spaces  (58, Feng et al., 2019).\n\n- Adaptive Sampling: ADD-RRT framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) to identify local configuration space types, accelerating expansion around obstacles and through narrow passages  (93, Cai et al., 2021).\n\n- Probabilistic Mapping: Advanced RRT algorithms have been combined with probabilistic grid mapping of obstacle information for local path planning and obstacle avoidance  (96, Meng et al., 2021).\n\nThese optimization and refinement methods collectively aim to address the limitations of traditional RRT algorithms in narrow passages and complex environments, improving path quality, computational efficiency, and adaptability to various challenging scenarios.\n\nReferences:\n1.

It was introduced for ordinal trees and later simplified, forming the basis for applications to other tree types.\n\nThe tree covering technique, when applied to ordinal trees, exhibits specific characteristics that distinguish it from its application to other tree types. Notably, the order of nodes plays a crucial role in this approach. According to Valiente  <Paper corpusId=\"15391464\" paperTitle=\"(1, Valiente, 2001)\" isShortName></Paper>, when identifying isomorphic subtrees in ordinal trees, it is essential to select the leftmost subtree, specifically \"the one whose root has the least preorder number.\" This requirement ensures that the structural integrity and ordering of the original tree are preserved in the covering process.\n\nThe development of the tree covering technique for ordinal trees has been a significant contribution to the field of tree algorithms. Munro et al.  <Paper corpusId=\"70350051\" paperTitle=\"(3, Munro et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> note that this technique \"was introduced by Geary, Raman and Raman [11] (for ordinal trees) and later simplified by Farzan and Munro [6].\" This evolution of the technique demonstrates its importance and the ongoing efforts to refine its application to ordinal trees.\n\nWhile the tree covering technique has been predominantly used for ordinal trees, it's worth noting that it has served as a foundation for applications to other tree types. Munro et al.  <Paper corpusId=\"70350051\" paperTitle=\"(3, Munro et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> mention that the technique \"can be extended to support updates,\" highlighting its versatility.

It involves partitioning the tree into subtrees and using NCA-universal trees for efficient representation.\n\nThe application of the tree covering technique to binary trees differs from its use in ordinal trees, primarily in its focus and implementation. While the technique was initially developed for ordinal trees, it has been adapted and refined for use with binary trees, offering unique advantages in this context.\n\nFor binary trees, the tree covering technique centers around the concept of universal trees. Su et al.  <Paper corpusId=\"1891039\" paperTitle=\"(2, Su et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> describe a key aspect of this approach: \"The universal tree S n for binary trees of size at most n consists of three NCA-universal trees for binary trees of size at most n/2.\" This structure allows for efficient representation of binary trees by partitioning them into smaller components.\n\nThe implementation for binary trees involves a more specialized approach compared to ordinal trees. Su et al.  <Paper corpusId=\"1891039\" paperTitle=\"(2, Su et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> further explain that these universal trees \"consist of two NCA-universal trees for n/2-vertex binary trees with a marked leaf and of a single NCA-univeral tree for ordinary n - 1-vertex binary trees.\" This specific structuring enables the technique to handle the unique properties of binary trees effectively.\n\nWhile the tree covering technique has been predominantly used for ordinal trees, its application to binary trees represents an important extension. Munro et al.  <Paper corpusId=\"70350051\" paperTitle=\"(3, Munro et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> note that their presentation is \"geared towards succinctly storing static binary trees.\" This focus on binary trees demonstrates the technique's adaptability to different tree structures.\n\nIt's worth noting that the application of tree covering to binary trees maintains some similarities with its use in ordinal trees, particularly in terms of its goal of efficient representation.

These advances have led to improved understanding of the hierarchy's capabilities and limitations across different problem domains.\n\nThe Sherali-Adams (SA) hierarchy has been the subject of significant recent research, with several important developments expanding our understanding of its properties and applications. A key advancement has been the characterization of the SA relaxation for specific problem types. For instance, Butti et al. provided a new characterization of the SA relaxation for the homomorphism problem in terms of fractional isomorphism  <Paper corpusId=\"235755273\" paperTitle=\"(1, Butti et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This result offers a novel combinatorial perspective on the SA relaxation, potentially facilitating new lower bound proofs for concrete instances of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).\n\nBuilding on this work, Ciardo et al. introduced a multilinear algebra approach to studying the SA hierarchy  <Paper corpusId=\"247244554\" paperTitle=\"(57, Ciardo et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Their method characterizes when a level of the hierarchy accepts an instance in terms of a homomorphism problem for a multilinear structure obtained through tensor power of the constraint language. This approach provides a fresh perspective on the hierarchy's behavior and complements earlier characterizations.\n\nFurther expanding the theoretical framework, Dalmau et al. demonstrated that the SA hierarchy coincides with the \u03c9-consistency hierarchy associated with Q conv  <Paper corpusId=\"255749346\" paperTitle=\"(59, Dalmau et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This result establishes a connection between the SA relaxation and other consistency concepts in constraint satisfaction theory, potentially opening new avenues for analysis and application of the hierarchy.\n\nIn the context of valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs), significant progress has been made in understanding the power of SA relaxations. \u017divn\u00fd et al. showed that for a general-valued constraint language, the ability to solve any instance to optimality using a constant level of the SA hierarchy is equivalent to solving it using the third level, and is further equivalent to the support of the language satisfying the \"bounded width condition\" <Paper corpusId=\"3831066\" paperTitle=\"(38, \u017divn\u00fd et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper>. This result was further refined by Thapper et al., who provided a precise algebraic characterization of the power of SA relaxations for VCSPs  <Paper corpusId=\"5534758\" paperTitle=\"(29, Thapper et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. They demonstrated that the bounded width condition captures the power of local consistency methods for decision CSPs and showed that several novel and well-known valued constraint languages are tractable via the third level of the SA relaxation.\n\nCiardo et al. also contributed to unifying various relaxation hierarchies for CSPs and their Promise variants  <Paper corpusId=\"250311047\" paperTitle=\"(56, Ciardo et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Their framework encompasses the combinatorial bounded width, SA LP, affine IP, Sum-of-Squares SDP, and combined \"LP + affine IP\" hierarchies, providing a comprehensive view of these relaxation techniques.\n\nIn the specific domain of graph isomorphism, Berkholz et al. established a connection between a hierarchy of logics with counting and the SA hierarchy of relaxations for a natural linear programming formulation of the graph isomorphism problem  <Paper corpusId=\"12601674\" paperTitle=\"(30, Berkholz et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper>. This result illustrates the broad applicability of the SA hierarchy across different problem domains and its connections to other theoretical frameworks.\n\nThese recent advances collectively demonstrate the ongoing importance of the SA hierarchy in theoretical computer science and optimization.

[(30, Berkholz et al., 2016) | n_citations: 18 | Linear Diophantine Equations, Group CSPs, and Graph Isomorphism ]: \nThese systems form a hierarchy L 1 iso \u2282 L 2 iso \u2282 * * * and are equivalent to the Sherali-Adams hierarchy of relaxations for a natural linear programming formulation of the graph isomorphism problem, see [6] for a more detailed discussion of encodings.\n\n\n\nApplications and Limitations (Synthesis)\nTLDR: The Sherali-Adams hierarchy has shown promise in various optimization problems, particularly for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and their approximations. However, it also faces limitations in terms of computational complexity for higher levels of the hierarchy.\n\nRecent research has shed light on both the applications and limitations of the Sherali-Adams (SA) hierarchy in various optimization contexts. One of the most significant findings relates to its power in approximating constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).  <Paper corpusId=\"9844303\" paperTitle=\"(13, Chan et al., 2013)\" isShortName></Paper> and  <Paper corpusId=\"11416540\" paperTitle=\"(27, Kothari et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> demonstrated that for CSPs, polynomial-sized linear programs are essentially as powerful as those derived from a constant number of rounds of the SA hierarchy. This equivalence highlights the hierarchy's fundamental role in understanding the limitations of linear programming approaches to CSPs.\n\nFurther emphasizing the hierarchy's importance,  <Paper corpusId=\"46967297\" paperTitle=\"(40, Ghosh et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> showed that for every CSP, the approximation obtained by a basic LP relaxation is at least as strong as the approximation from O(log n / log log n) levels of the SA hierarchy on instances of size n. This result underscores the efficiency of simpler LP relaxations in relation to higher levels of the hierarchy.\n\nThe SA hierarchy has also found applications in specific optimization problems. For instance,  <Paper corpusId=\"159040876\" paperTitle=\"(47, Zhang et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper> suggested its potential in improving approximations for the Lowest Degree 2-Spanner problem. Additionally,  <Paper corpusId=\"221187090\" paperTitle=\"(53, Aprile et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> argued that the SA hierarchy is underutilized in designing approximation algorithms and encouraged its broader application.\n\nIn the context of maximum cut problems and Boolean CSPs, [44 | 56895342 | O'Donnell et al. | 2019 | Citations: 9] demonstrated that a certain number of rounds of the SA hierarchy can strongly certify bounds on maximum cut in specific graph types and refute random Boolean k-CSP instances. These results challenge the conventional belief that linear programming hierarchies perform poorly for such problems.\n\nThe theoretical foundations of the SA hierarchy have been linked to earlier mathematical works.  <Paper corpusId=\"52019848\" paperTitle=\"(35, Zhang et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper> noted that the convergence of the SA hierarchy can be justified by the works of Krivine, Cassier, and Handelman from the 1960s to 1980s, providing a historical perspective on its mathematical underpinnings.\n\nDespite its strengths, the SA hierarchy faces limitations, particularly in terms of computational complexity for higher levels.  <Paper corpusId=\"1554266\" paperTitle=\"(17, Kolliopoulos et al., 2014)\" isShortName></Paper> pointed out that for maximum constraint satisfaction problems, LPs of size n^k are exactly as powerful as O(k)-level SA relaxations in terms of approximation. This equivalence implies that while higher levels of the hierarchy can provide tighter approximations, they come at the cost of exponentially increasing problem size.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Sherali-Adams hierarchy has proven to be a powerful tool in theoretical computer science and optimization, particularly for CSPs and their approximations, its practical application is often limited to lower levels due to computational complexity constraints. Nonetheless, its theoretical importance in understanding the limits of linear programming approaches to various optimization problems remains significant.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Interestingly, the wellfoundedness of this approach, and indeed the convergence of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy, can be justified by the works of Krivine [99], [100] in 1964, as well as those of Cassier [101] (in 1984) and Handelman [102] (in 1988).\n\n7.

These results demonstrate both the power and limitations of the hierarchy in approximating hard optimization problems.\n\nRecent studies have provided important insights into the lower bounds and integrality gaps associated with the Sherali-Adams (SA) hierarchy for various optimization problems. These findings help delineate the limitations of the hierarchy and inform its practical applications.\n\nFor the Densest k-subgraph problem,  <Paper corpusId=\"1554324\" paperTitle=\"(4, Bhaskara et al., 2011)\" isShortName></Paper> established a lower bound of \u03a9(n^(1/4)/log^3 n) on the integrality gap for \u03a9(log n/log log n) rounds of the SA relaxation. This result highlights the challenge of approximating this problem even with a significant number of SA rounds.\n\nIn the context of Max k-CSPs,  <Paper corpusId=\"7479290\" paperTitle=\"(26, Raghavendra et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> demonstrated an O(q^(1/i))-approximation algorithm for dense instances with alphabet size q using O_k(i) levels of the SA relaxation. Through their birthday repetition theorem, they also obtained an integrality gap of q^(1/i) for \u00d5_k(i)-level Lasserre relaxation for fully-dense Max k-CSP. This result establishes a connection between the approximability of these problems and the power of SA relaxations.\n\nFurther exploring Max k-CSPs,  <Paper corpusId=\"7694457\" paperTitle=\"(9, Benabbas et al., 2012)\" isShortName></Paper> showed that for every constant \u03b6 > 0, there exist c = c(q, k, \u03b6) such that for large enough n, the integrality gap of MAX k-CSP_q(P) for the program obtained by cn levels of the SA SDP hierarchy is at least a certain threshold. This finding suggests that even with a substantial number of SA rounds, there remain hard instances for which the relaxation provides limited tightness.\n\nOn a more positive note,  <Paper corpusId=\"220546220\" paperTitle=\"(48, Aprile et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> demonstrated that for the Cluster-VD problem, performing r = poly(1/\u03b5) rounds of the SA hierarchy produces an LP relaxation with an integrality gap of at most 2 + \u03b5 for any fixed \u03b5 > 0. This result indicates that for some problems, the SA hierarchy can provide tight approximations with a sufficient number of rounds.\n\nFor the maximum cut problem,  <Paper corpusId=\"208267873\" paperTitle=\"(50, Hopkins et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper> showed that the degree-n^\u03b5 SA linear program approximates the problem within a factor of (1/2 + \u03b5'), for some \u03b5'(\u03b5) > 0. This finding suggests that even for NP-hard problems like Max-Cut, the SA hierarchy can provide non-trivial approximation guarantees.\n\nRegarding lower bounds for specific problems, <Paper corpusId=\"5077025\" paperTitle=\"(39, Chlamt'avc et al., 2018)\" isShortName></Paper> highlighted that the only non-trivial matching lower bound shown so far is that of Bhaskara et al., who demonstrated that \u03a9(log n/ log log n) rounds of the SA hierarchy have a matching integrality gap only for the case of \u03b1 = 1/2 and k = \u221an in the context of the Densest k-subgraph problem.\n\nFor vertex cover and related problems,  <Paper corpusId=\"9912036\" paperTitle=\"(21, Bazzi et al., 2015)\" isShortName></Paper> showed that there exists a solution to the LP relaxation obtained after r = n^\u03ba rounds of the SA relaxation with a value of 1 - \u03b5. This result indicates that even with a polynomial number of SA rounds, the relaxation may not tighten sufficiently for some problems.\n\nLastly,  <Paper corpusId=\"3505875\" paperTitle=\"(33, Ghosh et al., 2016)\" isShortName></Paper> simplified and strengthened a previous result, showing that \u03a9(log n / log log n) levels of the SA hierarchy are necessary to match the strength of polynomial-size LP extended formulations for certain problems. This finding underscores the relationship between the SA hierarchy and other LP-based approaches to optimization problems.\n\nThese results collectively demonstrate the ongoing efforts to understand the limitations and capabilities of the SA hierarchy across various optimization problems, providing valuable insights for both theoretical analysis and practical applications.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods often involve multi-step processes that combine question generation, answering, and verification to reduce hallucinations.\n\nQuestion generation (QG) has emerged as a powerful tool for mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). This approach leverages the ability to create targeted questions that can challenge and verify the content produced by these models.\n\nOne notable technique is the adaptation of question-answering (QA) frameworks to assess hallucination in model-generated summaries. Narayan et al. introduced a method that combines question generation and answer extraction models to create synthetic question-answer pairs  <Paper corpusId=\"218487034\" paperTitle=\"(3, Narayan et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, Wang et al. proposed QAGS, a system where a QG model generates questions about a given text, allowing for the detection and penalization of hallucinations in summaries  <Paper corpusId=\"215548661\" paperTitle=\"(4, Wang et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nMore recent approaches have expanded on these ideas, incorporating multi-step processes and verification techniques.

Chen et al. presented the 'Rephrase and Respond' (RaR) method, which allows LLMs to rephrase and expand human-posed questions before providing responses  <Paper corpusId=\"265043536\" paperTitle=\"(22, Chen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.

These approaches involve iterative processes, claim decomposition, and comparison techniques to improve the accuracy and reliability of generated responses.\n\nSelf-reflection and verification methods have emerged as promising approaches to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). These techniques leverage the LLM's own capabilities to detect and correct inaccuracies in their generated content.\n\nOne notable approach is the iterative self-reflection process proposed by Lee et al., which aims to refine LLM responses and reduce hallucinations  <Paper corpusId=\"263828949\" paperTitle=\"(27, Lee et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This method demonstrates that LLMs can be used to improve their own outputs through repeated cycles of generation and evaluation.\n\nAgrawal et al. suggest that the ability of LLMs to detect their own hallucinations indicates that the problem may not be inherent to their training or representation, but rather in how they are used for generation  <Paper corpusId=\"258960346\" paperTitle=\"(18, Agrawal et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This insight has led to the development of various self-checking mechanisms.\n\nClarke et al. propose two related methods for self-detecting hallucinations. One approach involves querying an information retrieval system with factual statements from the LLM's output and then prompting the LLM to validate these statements against the retrieved evidence  <Paper corpusId=\"262063818\" paperTitle=\"(32, Clarke et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. In a similar vein, they also suggest using a retrieval method on a comprehensive corpus to perform self-fact-checking  <Paper corpusId=\"259251952\" paperTitle=\"(35, Clarke et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Both methods essentially allow the LLM to cross-reference its own output against external information sources.\n\nFor complex questions, Balepur et al. introduce the answer-based claim decomposition (ABCD) strategy  <Paper corpusId=\"258865288\" paperTitle=\"(51, Balepur et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This method breaks down questions into a series of true/false claims, allowing for a more granular verification of the LLM's responses against the original query criteria.\n\nA novel approach by Yehuda et al. involves prompting the model multiple times to reconstruct the input query using the generated answer  <Paper corpusId=\"268248107\" paperTitle=\"(62, Yehuda et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. By comparing the embeddings of these reconstructed questions with the original query, they produce a score indicating the likelihood of hallucination in the answer.\n\nThese self-reflection and verification methods represent a growing trend in hallucination mitigation strategies. By enabling LLMs to critically examine their own outputs and compare them against either external sources or the original input, these approaches aim to improve the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. As research in this area continues, we can expect further refinements and innovations in self-verification techniques for LLMs.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(51, Balepur et al., 2023) | n_citations: 0 | Mastering the ABCDs of Complex Questions: Answer-Based Claim Decomposition for Fine-grained Self-Evaluation ]: \nWhen answering complex questions, large language models (LLMs) may produce answers that do not satisfy all criteria of the question... we propose answer-based claim decomposition (ABCD), a prompting strategy that decomposes questions into a series of true/false claims that can be used to verify which criteria of the input question an answer satisfies.\n\n6. [(62, Yehuda et al., 2024) | n_citations: 1 | In Search of Truth: An Interrogation Approach to Hallucination Detection ]: \nTo identify hallucination in a generated answer, our approach involves prompting the model multiple times to reconstruct the input query using the generated answer... The set of recovered questions is then embedded by a language model and compared with the original question, producing a final score that determines whether the generated answer suffers from hallucination.\n\n\n\nIntegration with External Knowledge Sources\nTLDR: Integration with external knowledge sources is a powerful approach to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs. By grounding responses in reliable information from external databases or retrieval systems, these methods significantly improve the factual accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs.\n\nThe integration of external knowledge sources has emerged as a crucial strategy for mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). This approach addresses the inherent limitations of LLMs by supplementing their internal knowledge with accurate, up-to-date information from external sources.\n\nOne notable technique in this domain is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG enhances LLM performance by providing relevant queries and reference materials in advance, significantly reducing the tendency for hallucination and enabling more accurate response generation  <Paper corpusId=\"261531346\" paperTitle=\"(34, Jeong, 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This method effectively bridges the gap between the model's pre-trained knowledge and the specific information required for a given task.\n\nThe concept of knowledge-grounded response generation has gained traction as an effective means to combat hallucination in LLMs  <Paper corpusId=\"257636907\" paperTitle=\"(44, Sundar et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. By anchoring responses to verified external information, this approach ensures that the generated content remains factually accurate and relevant to the query at hand.\n\nIn the context of generative question-answering (QA), retrieval-based methods have shown promise in improving factual accuracy and reducing hallucinations. Techniques such as GenQA and WebGPT exemplify this approach, leveraging external knowledge sources to ground their responses in verifiable information  <Paper corpusId=\"260881388\" paperTitle=\"(47, Nguyen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRefGPT represents another innovative solution that incorporates reliable references to minimize hallucination and untruthful content generation in dialogue systems  <Paper corpusId=\"258865446\" paperTitle=\"(52, Yuan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. By consistently referring to trustworthy external sources, RefGPT ensures that its responses are both accurate and contextually appropriate.\n\nA particularly promising framework is the \"Decompose-and-Query\" (D&Q) approach introduced by Cao et al. This method guides the model to think and utilize external knowledge in a manner similar to the ReAct framework while constraining its reasoning to reliable information. By doing so, D&Q effectively mitigates the risk of hallucinations  <Paper corpusId=\"265149412\" paperTitle=\"(53, Cao et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese approaches to integrating external knowledge sources represent a significant advancement in hallucination mitigation for LLMs. By grounding model responses in verifiable, external information, these methods not only improve the factual accuracy of generated content but also enhance the overall reliability and trustworthiness of LLM outputs. As research in this area progresses, we can expect to see further refinements and innovations in techniques that leverage external knowledge to combat hallucinations.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This framework guides the model to think and utilize external knowledge similar to ReAct, while also restricting its thinking to reliable information, effectively mitigating the risk of hallucinations.\n\n\n\nEvaluation and Detection of Hallucinations\nTLDR: Evaluation and detection of hallucinations in LLMs involve developing automated methods and benchmarks to identify and measure inaccuracies in model outputs. These approaches range from reference-based techniques to more sophisticated methods that leverage the LLMs' own capabilities for self-assessment and verification.\n\nThe evaluation and detection of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) have become crucial areas of research as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Researchers have developed various approaches to identify and measure the prevalence of hallucinations in LLM outputs.\n\nOne notable approach involves the automated collection of LLM hallucinations. Cao et al. proposed a method where LLMs are prompted to generate references for claims in existing datasets, focusing on both factual (supported) and fake (unsupported) claims  <Paper corpusId=\"263334406\" paperTitle=\"(1, Cao et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This technique allows for the creation of comprehensive datasets that can be used to train and evaluate hallucination detection models.\n\nThe development of specialized benchmarks has also played a significant role in assessing LLMs' tendency to hallucinate. Shi et al. noted that certain benchmarks explore hallucination in the context of question-answering, evaluating the ability of LLMs to provide truthful answers to knowledge-intensive questions  <Paper corpusId=\"261530162\" paperTitle=\"(9, Shi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. These benchmarks serve as important tools for measuring progress in hallucination mitigation.\n\nSome researchers have focused on developing methods that treat the LLM as a black box. Azaria et al. discussed approaches that use different prompting techniques, including multiple queries, to achieve better performance and reduce hallucinations  <Paper corpusId=\"258352729\" paperTitle=\"(13, Azaria et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This strategy leverages the LLM's own capabilities to improve the accuracy of its outputs.\n\nIn the domain of information-seeking dialogues and open-domain question answering, Chang et al. demonstrated that certain methods could significantly reduce the hallucination problem in LLMs  <Paper corpusId=\"259982533\" paperTitle=\"(21, Chang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. These findings highlight the importance of task-specific evaluation and mitigation strategies.\n\nThe detection and mitigation of hallucinatory content have been recognized as essential for expanding the application of LLMs to domain-specific question-answering tasks. Sadat et al. emphasized the crucial need for developing automatic hallucination detection and handling methods to improve the reliability of LLM-based question-answering systems  <Paper corpusId=\"266149537\" paperTitle=\"(31, Sadat et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn the context of document analysis and information retrieval, Kintz et al. pointed out that the tendency of generative AI models like ChatGPT to hallucinate fake content limits their applicability. They suggested that extractive language models, such as those used for question answering or passage retrieval, can guarantee that query results are found within the boundaries of a given context document, potentially reducing hallucinations  <Paper corpusId=\"262822521\" paperTitle=\"(45, Kintz et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nInnovative approaches to hallucination detection continue to emerge. Wu et al. proposed a framework that uses LLMs to enhance dialogue response generation by asking questions to detect users' implicit intentions, demonstrating superior ability in generating questions relevant to knowledge beyond the given context  <Paper corpusId=\"263672020\" paperTitle=\"(48, Wu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This method not only improves response quality but also serves as a potential tool for identifying and mitigating hallucinations.\n\nRecent research has also explored the role of entity prediction in reducing hallucinations. Lin et al. showed that predicting or providing salient entities to various model architectures can enhance performance and help derive higher-quality summaries by alleviating the entity hallucination problem in abstractive summarization  <Paper corpusId=\"267334945\" paperTitle=\"(69, Lin et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAs the field progresses, these evaluation and detection methods for hallucinations in LLMs continue to evolve, providing researchers and practitioners with increasingly sophisticated tools to assess and improve the factual accuracy and reliability of LLM-generated content.\n\nReferences:\n1.

While pre-trained embeddings can offer initial advantages, randomly initialized embeddings often catch up or even outperform pre-trained ones in various tasks.\n\nThe debate between using randomly initialized embeddings versus pre-trained embeddings in transformer models has been a subject of extensive research, yielding diverse findings across different tasks and model architectures.\n\nSome studies have found that pre-trained embeddings can provide initial advantages. For instance, Singh et al. observed that pretrained word embeddings generally outperform random embeddings across 1,500 rounds of training, with randomly initialized embeddings requiring more training rounds to achieve the same level of accuracy early in the process  <Paper corpusId=\"218581361\" paperTitle=\"(12, Singh et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Similarly, Kao et al. reported that BERT models with randomly initialized and fine-tuned word embedding layers performed worse than those using the whole pre-trained weights  <Paper corpusId=\"232223167\" paperTitle=\"(18, Kao et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHowever, other research suggests that random initialization can be equally effective or even superior in some cases.

While some studies demonstrate faster convergence and better performance with pre-trained embeddings, others find that random initialization can achieve comparable results within a short period of training.\n\nThe convergence and training dynamics of transformer models with randomly initialized embeddings versus pre-trained embeddings have been extensively studied, revealing diverse outcomes across different scenarios.\n\nSome research indicates that pre-trained embeddings can lead to faster convergence and better performance. For instance,  <Paper corpusId=\"238215601\" paperTitle=\"(17, Huang et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper> found that in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), initialization with a pre-trained model provided significantly better results compared to random initialization, which produced erroneous predictions.

While pre-trained embeddings can offer initial advantages in some cases, randomly initialized embeddings often demonstrate the ability to catch up quickly during the training process.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The choice depends on factors like model architecture, input modality, and specific task requirements.\n\n- **Vision-Language Models**: In some vision-language models, researchers use a hybrid approach. For instance, Lin et al. randomly initialized their multi-layer transformer encoder while using ImageNet pre-trained weights for the CNN backbone  <Paper corpusId=\"229297707\" paperTitle=\"(7, Lin et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This approach allows for task-specific learning in the transformer while leveraging established visual features.\n\n- **Multilingual Models**: For multilingual BERT-based models, Botha et al. used pre-trained checkpoints for BERT-based encoders but randomly initialized the embeddings for a specific model (Model E)  <Paper corpusId=\"226254361\" paperTitle=\"(9, Botha et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. This strategy can help in adapting the model to new languages or domains not covered in the pre-training.\n\n- **Text-to-Image Models**: In text-to-image generation tasks, random initialization of text embeddings can lead to poor performance. Wen et al. found that random initialization fails to approximate the distribution of text embeddings in pre-trained Text-to-Image models, emphasizing the importance of appropriate initialization in this domain  <Paper corpusId=\"257766959\" paperTitle=\"(27, Wen et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n- **Audio-Visual Models**: For audio-visual tasks, the choice of initialization can vary based on input modality. Alonso-Jim\u00e9nez et al. evaluated different initialization strategies, including weights from DeiT for image input, PaSST model for mel-spectrogram input, and random initialization <Paper corpusId=\"263136526\" paperTitle=\"(28, Alonso-Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. This highlights the need to consider modality-specific pre-training when available.\n\n- **Fine-tuning BERT**: In BERT fine-tuning, while the classifier is typically initialized randomly, the embedding layer plays a crucial role. Ardakani notes that the embedding layer contains information about unseen data, making it a key element in the fine-tuning process  <Paper corpusId=\"256630734\" paperTitle=\"(26, Ardakani, 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This suggests that careful consideration should be given to the embedding layer's initialization during fine-tuning.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These structures offer various trade-offs between space and query time complexity.\n\n- Cartesian Trees: The Cartesian tree plays a central role in many RMQ solutions  (2, Weimann et al., 2009). This data structure efficiently encodes the relative order of elements, allowing for fast minimum queries.\n\n- Segment Trees: While primarily known for range sum queries, segment trees can be adapted to solve RMQ problems  (10, Ibtehaz et al., 2018). They are particularly useful for in-block queries in more complex RMQ data structures  (15, Yu et al., 2020).\n\n- LCA-based Structures: Many efficient RMQ data structures leverage the equivalence between RMQ and the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) problem  (6, Durocher, 2011). These structures often achieve O(n) space and O(1) query time complexity.\n\n- Specialized RMQ Structures: Recent research has proposed novel approaches to RMQ, such as the DPPDGP-Min1 and DPPDGP-Min2 methods  (17, Markatou et al., 2022). These structures aim to optimize specific aspects of RMQ performance.\n\n- Space-Efficient Structures: Some RMQ data structures focus on minimizing space usage while maintaining reasonable query times. For example, a structure using 2n+n/(log n t) \u03a9(t) + O(n^(3/4)) bits of space with O(t) query time has been proposed  (15, Yu et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(2, Weimann et al., 2009) | n_citations: 94 | On Cartesian Trees and Range Minimum Queries ]: \nIn all solutions to the RMQ problem the Cartesian tree plays a central role.\n\n2. [(10, Ibtehaz et al., 2018) | n_citations: 3 | Multidimensional segment trees can do range queries and updates in logarithmic time ]: \nSegment Trees [17]... Although Segment Trees are capable of computing a diverse set of functions, the simplest application of Segment Tree is to solve the range sum query problem.\n\n3. [(15, Yu et al., 2020) | n_citations: 5 | Lower bound for succinct range minimum query ]: \nThe state-of-the-art RMQ data structure uses 2n+n/( log n t ) \u03a9(t) + O(n 3/4 ) bits of space and answers queries in O(t) time... The two in-block RMQ can be easily answered by querying on at most two segment trees\n\n4. [(6, Durocher, 2011) | n_citations: 15 | A Simple Linear-Space Data Structure for Constant-Time Range Minimum Query ]: \nSeveral O(n), O(1) RMQ data structures exist, many of which depend on the equivalence between the range minimum query and lowest common ancestor (LCA) problems.\n\n5. [(17, Markatou et al., 2022) | n_citations: 0 | Time-and Space-Efficient Aggregate Range Queries on Encrypted Databases ]: \nDemertzis et al. [DPPDGP18] proposed two approaches to the RMQ problem which we refer to as DPPDGP-Min1 and DPPDGP-Min2.\n\n\n\nSpace and Time Complexities\nTLDR: RMQ data structures offer various trade-offs between space usage and query time. While some achieve constant query time with linear space, others prioritize space efficiency at the cost of slightly increased query times.\n\nThe space and time complexities of Range Minimum Query (RMQ) data structures have been a subject of extensive research, with various approaches offering different trade-offs:\n\n- Linear Space, Constant Query Time: A fundamental result in RMQ research is the existence of data structures that use O(n) space and support constant-time queries  (5, Larsen et al., 2011). This approach, often referred to as the \"textbook solution,\" forms the basis for many RMQ implementations  (16, Liu, 2021).\n\n- Space-Efficient Structures: Recent advancements have focused on reducing space requirements while maintaining reasonable query times. A notable structure uses 2n+o(n) bits of space with O(1) query time, achieved through clever use of Cartesian Trees  (1, Fischer, 2007). Further improvements have led to structures using 2n+n/(log n t) \u03a9(t) + O(n^(3/4)) bits of space with O(t) query time  (15, Yu et al., 2020).\n\n- Sublinear Space Structures: For scenarios where space is at a premium, structures with sublinear space usage have been developed. These typically come at the cost of increased query time, with some achieving O(log n) query time  (11, Gawrychowski et al., 2018).\n\n- Multi-dimensional RMQ: The complexity increases for higher-dimensional RMQ problems. For 2D range minimum queries, data structures with O(n log^\u03b5 n) space and O(log log U) query time have been developed  (4, Chan et al., 2011).\n\n- Practical Considerations: Many modern RMQ structures use a combination of techniques to balance space and time complexities. For instance, some employ segment trees for efficient in-block queries within larger RMQ structures  (15, Yu et al., 2020), while others leverage prepared overlapping RMQ queries to optimize performance  (16, Liu, 2021).\n\nThese diverse approaches to RMQ data structures allow developers to choose the most suitable solution based on their specific requirements for space efficiency and query performance.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(5, Larsen et al., 2011) | n_citations: 49 | Range selection and median: tight cell probe lower bounds and adaptive data structures ]: \nThe existence of linear space data structures that support range minimum queries (k fixed to 1) in constant time has been known for many years [19].\n\n2.

They serve as fundamental building blocks for solving problems in string processing, tree algorithms, and geometric computations.\n\n- Suffix Trees and String Processing: RMQ structures are essential components in the construction and operation of suffix trees, which are widely used in string algorithms  (8, Kowalski et al., 2017)  (9, Grabowski et al., 2017). They enable efficient solutions to problems such as the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) and Longest Common Extension (LCE) on strings  (12, Fineman et al., 2019)  (13, Munro et al., 2019).\n\n- Tree Algorithms: RMQ structures are fundamental in solving the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) problem on rooted trees, which has applications in various tree-based algorithms  (12, Fineman et al., 2019). They are also used to compute suffix links in suffix trees  (13, Munro et al., 2019).\n\n- Geometric Computations: RMQ solutions contribute to efficient algorithms for two-dimensional grids and orthogonal range searching problems  (8, Kowalski et al., 2017)  (13, Munro et al., 2019).\n\n- Graph Algorithms: RMQ structures serve as building blocks for various graph-related problems, enhancing the efficiency of algorithms in this domain  (12, Fineman et al., 2019).\n\n- Document Retrieval: RMQ data structures can be employed to speed up document retrieval queries, improving search performance in information retrieval systems  (13, Munro et al., 2019).\n\n- Sequence Analysis: RMQ structures facilitate efficient algorithms for finding maximal-scoring subsequences, which has applications in bioinformatics and data analysis  (13, Munro et al., 2019).\n\n- Data Compression: RMQ solutions contribute to the computation of Lempel-Ziv-77 factorizations when only the suffix array is available, aiding in data compression techniques  (13, Munro et al., 2019).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(8, Kowalski et al., 2017) | n_citations: 2 | Faster range minimum queries ]: \nSolutions for RMQ which are efficient in both query time and preprocessing space and time are building blocks in such succinct data structures as, e.g., suffix trees, two-dimensional grids or ordinal trees.\n\n2.

Common objectives include masked language modeling, query execution prediction, and contrastive learning, with a focus on capturing table-specific relationships and semantics.\n\nPre-training methods for table-specific tasks have evolved to leverage the unique structure and content of tabular data. Many approaches adapt techniques from language model pre-training, while others introduce novel objectives tailored to tabular data.\n\nA common strategy is to extend masked language modeling to tabular contexts. TaBERT and TaPas, for instance, concatenate tabular data with associated text and apply BERT's masked language modeling objective  (3, Manjunatha et al., 2021). This approach allows models to learn joint representations of tables and text.\n\nSeveral models focus on SQL query execution as a pre-training task. TAPEX synthesizes a large-scale corpus of SQL queries and their execution results, pre-training the model to output these results  (2, Lou et al., 2021)  (5, Guo et al., 2021). Similarly, POET-SQL pre-trains on a query result selection task, allowing encoder-only language models to benefit from SQL execution  (43, Lin et al., 2022).\n\nNovel objectives specific to tabular data have also been introduced. FORTAP leverages spreadsheet formulas for pre-training, using objectives like numerical reference prediction and numerical calculation prediction  (4, Dong et al., 2021). Vertical-Partition Contrastive Learning (VPCL) enables pre-training on multiple tables and facilitates fine-tuning on target datasets  (42, Sun et al., 2022).\n\nSome approaches use a combination of pre-training objectives. For example, GetPt employs three pre-training objectives to learn better table representations  (95, Jin et al., 2023). Others, like STRUG, use large fine-grained labeled datasets such as ToTTo for pre-training  (6, Zhou et al., 2022)  (17, Awadallah et al., 2020).\n\nRecent trends include exploring federated learning for pre-training on diverse tabular datasets  (7, Erickson et al., 2023) and adapting data augmentation techniques like Mixup and CutMix to tabular data pre-training  (70, Chen et al., 2023).\n\nOverall, pre-training methods for table-specific tasks aim to capture the unique structure and relationships within tabular data while leveraging advances in language model pre-training. The diversity of approaches reflects the ongoing research to find optimal strategies for learning table representations and improving performance on downstream tasks.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These architectures range from simple flattening approaches to more complex designs that incorporate table-specific encodings and hierarchical structures.\n\nTable pre-training architectures have evolved significantly to better capture the unique characteristics of tabular data. Many approaches build upon transformer-based language models, adapting them to handle the structured nature of tables.\n\nOne common approach is to flatten tables into sequences and use traditional language model architectures. TaBERT, for instance, concatenates tabular data with associated text and applies BERT's masked language modeling objective for pre-training  (15, Yin et al., 2020). Similarly, TaPas extends BERT to jointly learn representations for sentences and tables  (3, Manjunatha et al., 2021).\n\nMore sophisticated architectures have been developed to better capture table structure. TUTA pre-trains on general tables with hierarchies to model table structural information  (34, Dong et al., 2021). TABBIE furthers the design of TaBERT by using two independent transformers to encode the rows and columns of tables jointly  (81, Chen et al., 2023).\n\nSome models focus on specific table-related tasks. TAPEX, for example, uses an encoder-decoder architecture pre-trained on a large synthetic SQL dataset to perform as a SQL executor  (110, Li et al., 2024). REalTabFormer employs an autoregressive (GPT-2) transformer to model non-relational tabular data for generating parent tables  (69, Dupriez et al., 2023).\n\nRecent trends include adapting pre-trained language models for tabular data. TURL further pre-trains a pre-trained language model using table data to make it more suitable for tabular tasks  (27, Chen et al., 2021). Some approaches, like XTab and ORCA, focus on transferring large-scale pre-trained transformers for tabular data  (74, Zhou et al., 2023).\n\nResearchers are also exploring architectures that can handle diverse table collections. Some models are designed to pre-train across tables that vary in the number and types of columns  (112, Wang et al., 2024). SHEETPT refines model architecture and pre-training tasks specifically for spreadsheets  (89, Du et al., 2023).\n\nThe diversity of architectures reflects ongoing efforts to find optimal ways to represent and learn from tabular data. While many build on existing language model architectures, there's a clear trend towards developing table-specific structures and pre-training objectives to better capture the unique properties of tabular data.\n\nReferences:\n1.

SHEETPT refers to the design of table pre-training approaches and refining the model architecture and pre-training tasks with regard to the particularity of spreadsheets.\n\n\n\nDownstream Tasks and Fine-tuning\nTLDR: Pre-trained table models are applied to a diverse range of downstream tasks, including question answering, semantic parsing, and classification. Fine-tuning strategies often involve task-specific adaptations and demonstrate significant performance improvements over non-pre-trained baselines.\n\nPre-trained table models have shown remarkable versatility and effectiveness when fine-tuned for various downstream tasks. These tasks span a wide range of applications, from natural language interactions with tabular data to complex reasoning and generation tasks.\n\nQuestion answering over tables is a prominent downstream task. Models like TaBERT and TaPas have achieved state-of-the-art results on benchmarks such as WikiTableQuestions when fine-tuned for this task  (15, Yin et al., 2020). Similarly, TAPEX, which is pre-trained on SQL execution, has shown strong performance on table-based question answering tasks after fine-tuning  (48, Zhang et al., 2022).\n\nSemantic parsing, particularly text-to-SQL tasks, is another important application. Models like STRUG have outperformed existing baselines on realistic text-to-SQL datasets after fine-tuning  (17, Awadallah et al., 2020). Some approaches, like the one proposed by Rijke et al., use ground-truth SQL queries from datasets like Spider for pre-training, which aids in downstream performance on multi-table reasoning tasks  (79, Rijke et al., 2023).\n\nClassification tasks, especially in healthcare domains, have also benefited from table pre-training. TabRet, for instance, achieved the best AUC performance on four healthcare datasets after being pre-trained on public health surveys and fine-tuned for classification  (10, Oono et al., 2023).\n\nOther downstream tasks include cell type classification, formula prediction, and faithful text generation  (89, Du et al., 2023). Some models, like TURL, have been fine-tuned and evaluated on multiple tasks for table understanding and augmentation  (115, Koleva et al., 2024).\n\nFine-tuning strategies often involve task-specific adaptations. For instance, TabPTM represents instances through their distance to a fixed number of prototypes, which helps standardize heterogeneous tabular datasets and enables promising performance even in few-shot scenarios  (11, Zhou et al., 2023). Some approaches explore few-shot learning by fine-tuning pre-trained tabular models on new datasets with limited samples  (75, Wang et al., 2023).\n\nComparative studies have highlighted the effectiveness of table pre-training methods across different tasks. Zhao et al. implemented and compared six table pre-training models on various datasets, including question answering, fact checking, and text generation tasks  (82, Zhao et al., 2023). These studies consistently show that pre-trained models outperform non-pre-trained baselines, often by significant margins  (16, Huang et al., 2020).\n\nThe diversity of downstream tasks and the consistent performance improvements demonstrate the value of table pre-training in enhancing model capabilities for tabular data understanding and manipulation across various domains and applications.\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "183575a6b64714da860ca0dd4b2d1f48", "answer_text": "Structural challenges\nTLDR: Adapting transformer models for tabular data faces challenges due to the unique structural properties of tables, including row-column permutation invariance and hierarchical organization. These differences from unstructured text require modifications to standard transformer architectures.\n\nTransformer models, originally designed for unstructured text, face several structural challenges when adapted for tabular data representation. One of the primary issues is that tables are inherently different from free-form text in their organization and semantic structure  (1, Fainman et al., 2023). Unlike text, tables are largely invariant to row and column permutations, meaning that swapping rows or columns typically does not alter the table's overall meaning  (1, Fainman et al., 2023)  (34, Huang et al., 2023). This property poses a challenge for standard transformer models, which are designed to process sequential information.\n\nAnother significant challenge is the need to model the row-column structure of tables, which is crucial for correctly interpreting relational data  (8, Yu et al., 2020). The hierarchical nature of tabular data, with its complex relationships between headers, rows, and cells, is not naturally captured by the sequential processing of traditional transformers  (34, Huang et al., 2023).\n\nTo address these issues, researchers have found it necessary to extend and modify the typical transformer architecture  (32, Saeed et al., 2023). These adaptations aim to account for the richer and more structured nature of tabular data compared to free text. However, the fundamental structural differences between textual and tabular data make it challenging to use existing learning models without significant modifications  (16, Bedathur et al., 2021).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(1, Fainman et al., 2023) | n_citations: 26 | Table-GPT: Table-tuned GPT for Diverse Table Tasks ]: \ntables are largely \"invariant\" to row and column permutations, where swapping two rows or columns do not generally change the semantic meaning of the table... We can see that it is clearly challenging for language models to read tables in the column direction... All of these make tables different from texts, likely rendering languagemodels sub-optimal for table use cases\n\n2. [(34, Huang et al., 2023) | n_citations: 9 | HYTREL: Hypergraph-enhanced Tabular Data Representation Learning ]: \nLanguage models pretrained on large collections of tabular data have demonstrated their effectiveness in several downstream tasks.

[(8, Yu et al., 2020) | n_citations: 3 | TURL ]: \nHowever, Transformer is originally designed for unstructured text sequences and cannot model the row-column structure, which is important for interpreting relational tables.\n\n4. [(32, Saeed et al., 2023) | n_citations: 33 | Transformers for Tabular Data Representation: A Survey of Models and Applications ]: \nExtensions on the typical transformer architecture are applied to account for the tabular structure, which is different and richer in some aspects than traditional free text.\n\n5. [(16, Bedathur et al., 2021) | n_citations: 2 | BERT Meets Relational DB: Contextual Representations of Relational Databases ]: \nThe structural difference between the textual and tabular data makes it hard to use the existing learning models out of the box.\n\n\n\nData representation issues\nTLDR: Adapting transformer models for tabular data faces challenges in effectively representing the unique structure and content of tables. These issues include handling numerical values, preserving table structure, and dealing with context window limitations.\n\nTransforming tabular data into a format suitable for transformer models presents several significant challenges. One of the primary issues is the loss of structural information when converting tables into linear sequences. This linearization process often results in the loss of valuable two-dimensional contextual information inherent to structured data  (51, Gubanov et al., 2023). The problem is compounded by the fact that many methods naively treat table tuples as sentences, further diminishing the rich relational context present in tabular formats  (51, Gubanov et al., 2023).\n\nAnother crucial challenge lies in the representation of numerical values. Some approaches, such as GReaT and TapTap, fine-tuned models like GPT-2 on templated table texts, treating numerical values as strings. This approach led to insensitivity to these values, potentially compromising the model's ability to perform numerical reasoning or comparisons  (3, Zheng et al., 2024).\n\nThe context window limitation of transformer models poses an additional hurdle. Large tables often exceed the token length capacity of these models, making it difficult for them to comprehend global tabular information  (33, Chen et al., 2023). This limitation is exacerbated when attempting to represent all table information in a linear sequence, resulting in verbose representations that frequently surpass the context window limits of popular transformer models  (43, Agirre et al., 2023).\n\nThe sensitivity of transformer models to input formats presents yet another challenge. Research has shown that the performance of large language models (LLMs) can vary significantly depending on how tabular data is converted into text format  (54, Socolinsky et al., 2024)  (53, Nikolic et al., 2023). This sensitivity highlights the need for careful consideration of serialization methods when adapting these models for tabular data tasks.\n\nFurthermore, existing approaches often overlook the distinctions between dynamic and static fields in sequential tabular data. By replicating and filling static fields into each record, these methods introduce computational overhead and may yield less meaningful representations. Additionally, they often disregard temporal information between rows, potentially missing important behavioral patterns implied by time intervals  (2, Dai et al., 2023).\n\nThe linearization process can also impair the model's ability to recognize table structures accurately. This limitation becomes particularly evident when dealing with tables containing repetitive or similar data cells, leading to errors in tasks such as table transposition  (42, Chen et al., 2023).\n\nLastly, there are ongoing challenges in accurately representing numeric tables and tables without descriptive headers  (37, Hulsebos et al., 2023). These issues underscore the need for more sophisticated approaches to data representation that can capture the nuances of various tabular formats and content types.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(37, Hulsebos et al., 2023) | n_citations: 2 | Models and Practice of Neural Table Representations ]: \nWe will also explore a few general challenges of LM-based transformers for tabular data such as accurately representing numeric tables and tables without descriptive headers.\n\n\n\nPerformance limitations\nTLDR: Transformer models face significant performance challenges when applied to tabular data, including difficulties in handling table structures, limitations in task generalization, and issues with data representation. These challenges highlight the need for specialized adaptations and improvements to enhance transformer models' effectiveness for tabular tasks.\n\nTransformer models, despite their success in natural language processing, encounter several performance limitations when adapted for tabular data representation and analysis. One of the primary challenges is the models' struggle to effectively handle the unique structure of tables. Traditional transformer architectures, designed for unstructured text, often underperform when dealing with tables without associated text, as they fail to fully capture the tabular structure  (10, Manjunatha et al., 2021). This limitation becomes more pronounced when dealing with irregular table structures containing segments and subtables, leading to weaker overall performance  (17, Chen, 2022).\n\nThe application of transformer architectures to tabular data remains limited, particularly in tasks such as standard classification and regression with text and tabular features  (13, Mueller et al., 2021). This limitation is partly due to the models' lack of ability to understand tables inherently  (22, Kertkeidkachorn et al., 2022). Pre-training on unstructured data further exacerbates this issue when the models are applied to structured tabular data  (14, Smith et al., 2021).\n\nAnother significant challenge is the models' struggle to generalize across various table-related tasks. While some transformer-based models have shown promise in specific areas like table question answering and fact verification, they often lack the versatility to handle a broader range of table tasks effectively  (55, Chen et al., 2024). This limitation is particularly evident in domains requiring specialized knowledge, such as medical tabular data prediction, where issues like under-utilization of unstructured free-text and limited exploration of textual information in structured data persist  (41, Lan et al., 2023).\n\nThe hierarchical structure and long-tailed nature of tables also pose challenges for language models, limiting their performance in tasks that require reasoning over semi-structured tables  (29, Goyal et al., 2022). To address these issues, researchers have explored various adaptations, such as modifying attention mechanisms to better align with tabular data or designing hierarchical encoding to capture table structure  (56, Peter et al., 2024). However, these adaptations often require significant modifications to the standard transformer architecture.\n\nIn scenarios with limited labeled data, such as in highly technical domains like spreadsheets, fine-tuning transformer-based models becomes particularly challenging  (24, Buckley et al., 2022). This highlights the need for specialized approaches that can leverage the tabular inductive bias to improve model convergence and performance in low-resource settings.\n\nOverall, while transformer models have shown potential in certain tabular data tasks, their performance limitations underscore the need for continued research and development of specialized architectures and training approaches tailored to the unique challenges posed by tabular data representation and analysis.\n\nReferences:\n1.

We show that this boosts performance in our low-resource scenario considerably... Our experiments confirm that a table transformer outperforms other baselines and that its tabular inductive bias is vital for convergence of transformer-based models.\n\n\n\nComputational constraints\nTLDR: Adapting transformer models for tabular data faces significant computational challenges, primarily due to input size limitations and processing complexity. These constraints become particularly acute when dealing with large tables or high-dimensional data, necessitating efficient preprocessing and novel architectural solutions.\n\nTransformer-based models, while powerful for many natural language processing tasks, encounter substantial computational constraints when applied to tabular data representation. One of the primary challenges is the limitation on the maximum size of input text that these models can process  (20, Oliveira et al., 2022). This constraint becomes particularly problematic when dealing with large tables, as serializing such data often results in sequences that exceed the processing capacity of classical transformer-based models  (45, Chen et al., 2023).\n\nThe computational complexity of transformer models poses another significant hurdle. The quadratic relationship between input sequence length and computational requirements means that processing large tables can lead to prohibitively long run-times, especially when dealing with substantial volumes of data  (20, Oliveira et al., 2022). This issue is exacerbated in scenarios where table data is exceptionally large, potentially rendering the model incapable of encoding the complete dataset  (9, Bagwe et al., 2020).\n\nFurthermore, the high-dimensional nature of many tabular datasets presents additional computational challenges. Efficient pre-processing of categorical and numerical features becomes crucial to manage the computational load effectively  (44, Arora et al., 2023). These preprocessing steps, while necessary, add to the overall computational requirements of adapting transformer models for tabular data tasks.\n\nTo address these computational constraints, researchers and practitioners must explore innovative approaches. These may include developing more efficient encoding techniques, designing specialized architectures that can handle larger input sizes, or implementing novel preprocessing strategies to reduce the dimensional complexity of tabular data while preserving its essential characteristics [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. As the field progresses, finding solutions to these computational challenges will be crucial for the widespread adoption of transformer-based models in tabular data applications.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Popular approaches include artificial potential fields, dynamic window approaches, and velocity obstacle methods.\n\nReactive methods are crucial for safe navigation in partially observable environments with moving obstacles, as they allow robots to respond quickly to changes in their surroundings. These techniques prioritize real-time decision-making based on current sensor information, making them well-suited for dynamic and unknown environments  (9, Khatib et al., 1999).\n\nOne widely used reactive approach is the Artificial Potential Field (APF) method. An improved version of APF has been proposed for obstacle avoidance in unstructured environments, incorporating relative velocity and acceleration functions to enhance the smoothness of lane-changing paths  (418, Wang et al., 2024).\n\nThe Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) is another notable reactive method that searches for admissible controls directly in the linear and angular velocity space (48, Martinez-Gomez, 2010). An extension of this concept, the Forbidden Velocity Map, generalizes the Dynamic Window to consider obstacle and robot shape, velocity, and dynamics, resulting in a safe, real-time navigation algorithm for unpredictable and cluttered scenarios  (41, Damas et al., 2009).\n\nVelocity Obstacles (VO) and its variants, such as Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO) and Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA), form another family of effective reactive methods for dynamic environments (48, Martinez-Gomez, 2010)  (380, Liu et al., 2023). These approaches achieve navigation by deciding the next action through different planning strategies based on the perceived external information at each moment.\n\nRecent advancements have led to the development of hybrid approaches that combine multiple reactive methods. For instance, the A* fusion DWA algorithm has shown promise in achieving dynamic obstacle avoidance in environments with both static and moving obstacles  (358, Shi et al., 2023).\n\nWhile reactive methods excel in responding to immediate threats, they may struggle with long-term planning and global optimality. To address this limitation, some researchers have proposed combining reactive techniques with predictive and planning-based approaches to create more robust navigation systems  (9, Khatib et al., 1999)  (172, Aradi, 2020).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(9, Khatib et al., 1999) | n_citations: 601 | High-speed navigation using the global dynamic window approach ]: \nPlanning approaches are well suited for achieving a goal position in known static environments, while real-time obstacle avoidance methods allow reactive motion behavior in dynamic and unknown environments... combines methods from motion planning and real-time obstacle avoidance to result in a framework that allows robust execution of high-velocity, goal-directed reactive motion for a mobile robot in unknown and dynamic environments.\n\n2.

These methods include sampling-based techniques, model predictive control, and trajectory optimization, which can handle complex environments and moving obstacles.\n\nPredictive and planning-based approaches offer more sophisticated solutions for safe navigation in partially observable environments with moving obstacles. These methods aim to anticipate future states of the environment and plan optimal trajectories accordingly, often providing better long-term performance compared to purely reactive techniques.\n\nSampling-based motion planning algorithms have made significant progress in efficiently finding trajectories for high-dimensional and nonlinear systems. Examples include Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM), Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), and their variants  (26, Kavraki et al., 2007). These methods can be adapted for dynamic environments, with algorithms like RRT*-FDWA proposed to address the challenges of path planning and obstacle avoidance in uncertain, dynamic settings  (349, Zhou et al., 2023).\n\nModel Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful framework for navigation in dynamic environments. Chance-constrained MPC (CC-MPC) has been used to ensure robust collision avoidance for micro aerial vehicles by formulating the problem to keep collision probabilities below specified thresholds (176, Alonso-Mora et al., 2020). Another approach, SICNav, uses MPC to jointly solve for robot motion and predicted crowd motion in closed-loop, allowing for influence on pedestrian movement while maintaining safety constraints  (382, Samavi et al., 2023).\n\nTrajectory optimization methods have also been developed to handle dynamic obstacle avoidance. These approaches consider the entire volume of obstacles across prediction time steps, although this can sometimes result in conservative trajectories  (343, Li et al., 2023). To address this, some researchers have proposed novel trajectory cost formulations that reduce conservative behaviors and generate smoother paths  (356, Park et al., 2023).\n\nPrediction of pedestrian movements plays a crucial role in many planning-based approaches. Methods like the Social Force Model (SFM), Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO), and Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) provide foundational frameworks for anticipating human motion  (4, Dong et al., 2024). More advanced techniques, such as autoregressive Gaussian process motion models (AR-GPMM), have been used to predict pedestrian trajectories from a robot's partially-observable egocentric view  (82, Kim et al., 2014).\n\nIntegrating prediction with planning, some researchers have proposed methods that simulate future states considering the effects of robot actions on pedestrian intentions. For example, a global planner using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) has been developed to estimate the quality of local goals while accounting for human-robot interaction  (350, Oh et al., 2023).\n\nHybrid approaches that combine multiple techniques have shown promise in addressing the complexities of dynamic environments. For instance, algorithms combining probabilistic roadmaps with D*Lite have been proposed for safe navigation in obstacle-rich settings, although they may not always yield the optimal path  (364, Wei et al., 2023).\n\nWhile predictive and planning-based approaches offer advantages in terms of global optimality and long-term planning, they often require more computational resources compared to reactive methods. As such, ongoing research focuses on improving the efficiency and real-time performance of these techniques to make them more suitable for highly dynamic and partially observable environments.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This method reduces planning time but does not yield the optimal path.\n\n\n\nLearning-based Navigation Techniques\nTLDR: Learning-based approaches, particularly deep reinforcement learning (DRL), have emerged as powerful tools for navigation in dynamic environments. These methods can learn complex behaviors for obstacle avoidance and path planning, often outperforming traditional approaches in crowded and unpredictable scenarios.\n\nDeep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a prominent approach for tackling the challenges of safe navigation in partially observable environments with moving obstacles. DRL-based methods have shown remarkable capabilities in learning complex behaviors for collision avoidance and path planning, often surpassing traditional techniques in crowded and dynamic scenarios  (180, Patel et al., 2020)  (419, Gregory et al., 2024).\n\nOne of the key advantages of learning-based approaches is their ability to model the relationships between the robot, static obstacles, and moving pedestrians. For instance, Li et al. proposed a novel DRL architecture that combines spatial graph and attention reasoning to enhance navigation in environments with limited sensor range  (2, Li et al., 2022). Similarly, Xie et al. developed a learning-based control policy that uses a unique combination of lidar data, pedestrian kinematics, and subgoal information to generate steering angles and forward velocities, demonstrating strong generalizability to new environments  (339, Xie et al., 2023).\n\nSeveral researchers have focused on integrating DRL with other techniques to improve navigation performance. Riazuelo et al. combined a dynamic window approach with DRL, defining a reward function that encourages velocities moving away from obstacles  (3, Riazuelo et al., 2022). Sunilkumar et al. proposed a Nonlinear Model Predictive control-based RL framework for obstacle avoidance  (423, Sunilkumar et al., 2024).\n\nLearning-based methods have also shown promise in predicting obstacle motions and planning corresponding avoidance actions. Hu et al. developed a motion-prediction-based obstacle avoidance method using DRL, which constructs motion trend vectors to express the movement patterns of dynamic obstacles  (326, Hu et al., 2022). Garg et al. demonstrated that deep RL can be used to simultaneously predict obstacle motions and determine avoidance actions through trial-and-error learning  (159, Garg et al., 2019).\n\nTo improve the performance of DRL algorithms in dynamic environments, researchers have explored various enhancements. Min et al. proposed a PL-TD3-based path planning algorithm that combines the TD3 algorithm with LSTM units and a Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) strategy to improve convergence speed and perception of dynamic obstacles  (327, Min et al., 2022). Zhou et al. introduced the R-SARL framework, which augments the reward function to avoid collisions by estimating unsafe interactions between the robot and obstacles within a look-ahead distance  (254, Zhou et al., 2021).\n\nOne of the advantages of learning-based approaches is their potential for transfer learning. Lee et al. demonstrated a goal-oriented obstacle avoidance system based on DRL that uses depth information and goal positions as inputs. Their model, trained in simulation, could be directly transferred to other environments and was capable of avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles  (183, Lee et al., 2020).\n\nLearning-based navigation techniques have also been successfully applied to specific robotic systems. Guo et al. adopted a DRL algorithm to solve autonomous navigation and real-time obstacle avoidance for robot manipulators in dynamic obstacle environments  (344, Guo et al., 2023). In crowded scenarios, approaches like CrowdMove have been deployed for robotic navigation among dense groups of people  (177, Manocha et al., 2020).\n\nWhile learning-based navigation techniques have shown great promise, it's important to note that they often require significant computational resources and training data. Ongoing research focuses on improving the efficiency, generalizability, and real-time performance of these methods to make them more suitable for deployment in real-world, partially observable environments with moving obstacles [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods often integrate global planning with local reactive behaviors, enabling robots to navigate efficiently in complex, dynamic environments.\n\nHybrid and integrated approaches have emerged as powerful solutions for safe navigation in partially observable environments with moving obstacles. These methods combine different navigation techniques to capitalize on their respective strengths while mitigating their weaknesses.\n\nOne promising hybrid approach integrates global path planning with local obstacle avoidance. Song et al. proposed a method that combines the Artificial Potential Field (APF) and Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms for robotic manipulator path planning  (345, Song et al., 2023). This approach generates an initial static path and then uses real-time tracking of both static and dynamic obstacles to enable fast local re-planning, effectively balancing global efficiency with local responsiveness.\n\nAnother innovative hybrid method draws inspiration from natural systems. Wang et al. developed a distributed cooperative control algorithm that mimics the obstacle avoidance behavior of pigeons  (348, Wang et al., 2023). This approach incorporates an obstacle detection mechanism and a velocity adjustment mechanism, along with a collision avoidance system inspired by spring damping systems. By combining these biologically-inspired elements, the algorithm achieves safe flight and formation reconfiguration in dynamic environments.\n\nIntegrating learning-based approaches with traditional navigation methods has also shown promise. Hossain et al. combined the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance navigation in environments with mobile obstacles  (351, Hossain et al., 2023). This integration allows the robot to develop improved spatial awareness of moving obstacles through a carefully designed reward function, potentially leading to more effective obstacle avoidance behaviors.\n\nSome hybrid approaches focus on combining global and local planning strategies. Mendil et al. proposed a method that uses a global approach for motion along a desired path, employing 2nd order polynomial planning, while utilizing a local reactive approach based on neural control for collision avoidance with both static and dynamic obstacles  (97, Mendil et al., 2015). This approach was further extended to handle moving targets, demonstrating its flexibility in dealing with various dynamic scenarios.\n\nThese hybrid and integrated approaches showcase the potential for combining different navigation techniques to create more robust and adaptable systems. By leveraging the strengths of multiple methods, robots can better handle the complexities of partially observable environments with moving obstacles, achieving a balance between global efficiency and local responsiveness.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The proposed approach is extended to include the problem of moving target.\n\n\n\nConsiderations for Partially Observable Environments\nTLDR: Partially observable environments present unique challenges for safe navigation, requiring algorithms that can handle uncertainty and incomplete information. Approaches like extended RRTs, Bayesian learning, and biologically-inspired methods have been developed to address these challenges.\n\nIn partially observable environments, robots must navigate safely with limited or uncertain information about their surroundings. This scenario presents unique challenges that require specialized approaches to ensure effective and safe navigation.\n\nOne notable method for handling uncertainty in partially observable environments is the extension of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm. Ishigami et al. proposed modifications to RRT that explicitly consider robot mobility and parameter uncertainty using the stochastic response surface method (SRSM)  (40, Ishigami et al., 2009). This approach has shown promise in generating safe paths on uncertain, uneven terrain, demonstrating its potential for navigation in complex, partially observable environments.\n\nSampling-based methods, such as Probabilistic Roadmap Methods (PRM) and RRT, have been widely used for path planning in cluttered environments with obstacles  (114, Bestaoui et al., 2017). These techniques are particularly useful for nonholonomic vehicles, as they can efficiently explore the configuration space and find collision-free trajectories even with limited environmental information.\n\nTo address the social aspects of navigation in partially observable environments with pedestrians, Randhavane et al. developed SocioSense, a real-time algorithm for socially-aware robot navigation  (113, Randhavane et al., 2017). This approach uses Bayesian learning and Personality Trait theory to compute time-varying behaviors of pedestrians, combining psychological and social constraints to enable human-aware navigation in low- to medium-density crowds.\n\nLocal path planning plays a crucial role in adapting to partially observable environments. Li et al. emphasize the importance of real-time decision-making based on the surrounding environment to achieve autonomous obstacle avoidance and improve environmental adaptability  (275, Li et al., 2022). This highlights the need for algorithms that can quickly process available information and make informed decisions in dynamic, partially observable scenarios.\n\nBiologically-inspired approaches have also shown promise in navigating uncertain dynamic environments. Wang proposed several algorithms, including the biologically-inspired navigation algorithm (BINA) and the equidistant based navigation algorithm (ENA), which are efficient in terms of avoidance time and can navigate through uncertain dynamic environments  (91, Wang, 2014). These methods demonstrate the potential of mimicking natural behaviors to achieve safe navigation in complex, partially observable settings.\n\nIn summary, addressing the challenges of partially observable environments requires a combination of techniques that can handle uncertainty, adapt to dynamic conditions, and make efficient use of limited information. From extended sampling-based methods to socially-aware algorithms and biologically-inspired approaches, researchers continue to develop innovative solutions to enhance safe navigation in these complex scenarios.\n\nReferences:\n1.

They can get stuck in local solutions, potentially missing optimal paths through tight spaces.\n\nThe Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is a powerful tool for path planning, particularly in high-dimensional and constrained spaces  (12, Kirillova et al., 2007). Its strengths lie in its ability to quickly explore entire environments, generate sub-optimal paths, and handle complex constraints without modeling the entire space  (100, Tian et al., 2022)  (8, Huang et al., 2022). RRT-based methods are computationally efficient for offline path generation and offer probabilistic completeness  (68, Cheng et al., 2020).\n\nHowever, when confronted with narrow passages, RRT algorithms face significant challenges. The primary issue is that they can easily become limited to local solutions, struggling to find paths through tight spaces  (8, Huang et al., 2022). This limitation is particularly problematic for applications like microrobot navigation, where the ability to traverse narrow passages is crucial. The random sampling approach that makes RRT effective in open spaces can become a hindrance in tightly constrained environments, potentially missing optimal or even feasible paths through these critical areas [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nTo effectively adapt RRT-based path planning for narrow pathways, strategies must be developed to overcome these local minima and improve exploration in constrained spaces. This challenge sets the stage for various modifications and enhancements to the basic RRT algorithm, which will be explored in the following sections.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(100, Tian et al., 2022) | n_citations: 18 | Obstacle Avoidance Path Planning for the Dual-Arm Robot Based on an Improved RRT Algorithm ]: \nThe RRT algorithm, based on random search strategy, is suitable for path planning in high-dimensional space... The algorithm avoids modeling the entire space by detecting collisions at sample points in the state space... it can effectively solve path planning problems with complex constraints in high-dimensional space, and has the advantages of probabilistic completeness and perfect scalability.\n\n3.

These methods include obstacle-aware sampling, adaptive partitioning, and informed set pruning to enhance efficiency in constrained spaces.\n\nTo address the challenges of RRT-based path planning in narrow passages, researchers have developed various sampling strategies that aim to improve the algorithm's performance in constrained environments. One notable approach is the use of obstacle-aware sampling techniques. Lien et al. proposed a variant of RRT that incorporates multiple growth strategies, taking into account obstacles in the environment to more effectively explore narrow passages  (1, Lien et al., 2006). Similarly, Ferizbegovic et al. introduced an algorithm that uses dominant eigenvectors of configuration sets formed by sampling around the nearest node, enabling efficient tree expansion around obstacles and through narrow passages in a vine-like manner  (5, Ferizbegovic et al., 2018).\n\nAnother effective approach is the use of non-uniform sampling methods. Meng et al. embedded obstacle-based Gaussian sampling within uniform sampling to increase sample density in difficult-to-sample homotopy classes, improving planning efficiency in cluttered environments with narrow passages  (45, Meng et al., 2017). Gupta et al. proposed a novel non-uniform partitioning scheme that divides the area into obstacle-free convex cells, resulting in larger cells in open areas and smaller cells in obstacle-dense regions, which was then incorporated into the RRT* path planner  (91, Gupta et al., 2021).\n\nTo further enhance efficiency, some researchers have focused on reducing the sampling domain. Wu et al. discussed sampling domain reduction methods used in RRT*-smart, DDRRT, and IRRT* to improve RRT efficiency  (63, Wu et al., 2020). Choudhury et al. introduced the concept of the Informed Set, which conservatively prunes the configuration space to eliminate points that cannot yield shorter paths, while retaining asymptotic optimality  (82, Choudhury et al., 2021).\n\nLastly, the incorporation of heuristics into sampling strategies has shown promise. Merino et al. proposed a framework that allows for the integration of arbitrary heuristics to modify the sampling strategy according to user requirements, improving performance in terms of cost and time to find the first path, as well as the evolution of path quality with iterations  (33, Merino et al., 2016).\n\nThese advanced sampling strategies collectively aim to overcome the limitations of traditional RRT algorithms in narrow passages by focusing exploration on critical areas, adapting to the environment's geometry, and incorporating problem-specific knowledge to guide the search process more effectively.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(1, Lien et al., 2006) | n_citations: 204 | An obstacle-based rapidly-exploring random tree ]: \nHere we present a variant of the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) path planning algorithm that is able to explore narrow passages or difficult areas more effectively... The method includes many ways to grow the tree, some taking into account the obstacles in the environment... whereas the standard RRT can face difficulties planning in a narrow passage, the tree based planner presented here works best in these areas\n\n2.

Here we propose a framework that allows us to incorporate arbitrary heuristics to modify the sampling strategy according to the user requirements... We evaluate its performance in terms of the cost and time to find the first path, and in terms of the evolution of the path quality with the number of iterations.\n\n\n\nGuiding and Biasing Techniques\nTLDR: Guiding and biasing techniques for RRT algorithms enhance path planning in narrow passages by incorporating additional information or heuristics. These methods include guided sampling, local steering, and the use of artificial waypoints or learned models to improve exploration efficiency.\n\nTo improve RRT performance in narrow passages, researchers have developed various guiding and biasing techniques. One approach is to use guiding paths to focus sampling. Von\u00b4asek et al. proposed an iterative scaling approach that preferentially samples along a given guiding path, significantly increasing the success rate of finding feasible paths in high-dimensional configuration spaces compared to standard RRT algorithms (3, Von\u00b4asek et al., 2011).\n\nLocal guidance strategies have also shown promise. Zhou et al. introduced the Locally Guided Multiple Bi-RRT\u2217 (LGM-BRRT\u2217) method, which incorporates an improved bridge-test and a novel search strategy based on local guidance, resulting in faster solutions and more efficient memory utilization  (6, Zhou et al., 2019). Similarly, Koditschek et al. proposed a sensory steering algorithm that can \"feel\" the configuration space locally, significantly improving path planning performance near difficult regions like narrow passages  (44, Koditschek et al., 2017).\n\nFor constrained spaces, Kim et al. generalized the RRT algorithm to constraint manifolds by approximating them as collections of tangent spaces, preserving the key features of RRT-based planning while adapting to complex constraints  (21, Kim et al., 2014).\n\nSeveral techniques focus on guiding RRT expansion more efficiently. Yung et al. introduced spatial skeleton extraction to calculate the skeleton of free space, combined with a greedy algorithm to increase RRT expansion and reduce unnecessary bends, resulting in faster search processes and shorter path lengths  (102, Yung et al., 2022). Zhao et al. proposed GMMM-RRTs, which use Gaussian Mixture Models learned from experiential paths to bias sampling, efficiently exploiting local space while maintaining global planning efficiency  (53, Zhao et al., 2018).\n\nArtificial guidance has also been explored to improve RRT performance in cluttered environments. Qua presented a hybrid strategy using artificial-guided points to create a multi-RRT structure, enabling quick identification of traversable areas through local exploration and merge features  (25, Qua, 2014). Similarly, Zhang et al. introduced artificial-guided RRTs (AG-RRTs) that use artificial-guided waypoints to mark narrow passage regions, improving the efficiency of connecting and merging multiple RRTs  (19, Zhang et al., 2013).\n\nThese guiding and biasing techniques collectively aim to overcome the limitations of traditional RRT algorithms in narrow passages by focusing exploration on critical areas, incorporating problem-specific knowledge, and adapting to complex environmental constraints.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(19, Zhang et al., 2013) | n_citations: 2 | A human-computer interaction based path planning method for Mobile Robots in a complex environment ]: \nAiming at the problem of efficiency reduction that original RRTs planners have difficulties in automatically finding a resolution path in crowded regions of the robot's configuration space, A novel artificial-guided RRTs (AG-RRTs) planner based on multiple RRTs will be introduced. The AG-RRTs planner improves the efficiency of connection and mergence of multiple RRTs by artificial-guided waypoints which mark the regions of narrow passages.\n\n\n\nHybrid and Multi-Stage Approaches\nTLDR: Hybrid and multi-stage approaches combine different algorithms or techniques to improve RRT performance in narrow passages. These methods often use a global planner for overall navigation and local planners or specialized techniques for handling constrained areas.\n\nHybrid and multi-stage approaches have emerged as effective solutions for adapting RRT-based path planning to efficiently handle narrow pathways. These methods typically combine the strengths of different algorithms or employ multiple stages to address the challenges posed by constrained environments.\n\nOne notable approach is the two-stage method proposed by Wang et al., which uses a Bridge Test sampling algorithm to identify critical regions in the first stage, followed by Triple-RRTs to search for local connections in the second stage  (2, Wang et al., 2010). This approach effectively addresses the problem of multi-d.o.f. robot path planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces with narrow corridors.\n\nLi et al. introduced a hierarchical trajectory planner specifically designed for environments with narrow passages  (76, Li et al., 2021). Their planner consists of a graph search layer using a multistage hybrid A* algorithm to handle narrow passages, combined with a numerical optimal control layer for refinement.\n\nTo improve RRT performance in dense environments and narrow passages, Chen et al. proposed three enhancements to RRT-based algorithms  (86, Chen et al., 2021). These improvements aim to increase efficiency, adaptability, and suitability for various challenging environments.\n\nZhang et al. developed a Hybrid Frontier Detection (HFD) strategy for autonomous exploration, which combines a variable step-size random tree global frontier detector, a multi-root nodes random tree frontier detector, and a grid-based frontier detector  (90, Zhang et al., 2021). This hybrid approach effectively addresses exploration in environments with multiple obstacles and narrow entrances.\n\nLiu et al. proposed the GSLST algorithm, which uses Connect-RRT for global sampling trees and combines Closed-Operation and Jump Point Search (JPS) to extract narrow paths and create Local Dynamic Link Trees  (70, Liu et al., 2020). This hybrid method leverages the speed of sampling-based algorithms in open spaces while maintaining the completeness of search-based algorithms in complex environments with narrow paths.\n\nWhile RRT algorithms are known for their ability to quickly find feasible paths in high-dimensional spaces, they may not always produce optimal solutions or consistent results for the same motion planning problem  (57, Paulo et al., 2019). Hybrid and multi-stage approaches aim to address these limitations by combining RRT's strengths with complementary techniques, particularly for handling narrow passages efficiently.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods include bidirectional approaches, local replanning, path smoothing, and integration with machine learning techniques.\n\n- Bidirectional RRT: To improve performance in cluttered environments and narrow passages, bidirectional approaches like Bidirectional-RRT* have been proposed (83, Al-Darraji et al., 2021). Yu et al. further enhanced this by fusing bidirectional RRT with rapidly exploring random vines, showing improved planning performance in narrow roads  (108, Yu et al., 2022).\n\n- Local Replanning: Dynamic RRT algorithms have been developed for local replanning, preserving original points as much as possible  (137, Zhang et al., 2023). This approach can replace global planning in certain scenarios, offering more adaptability.\n\n- Path Smoothing: The Smooth RRT (S-RRT) algorithm generates smooth, curved continuous executable paths for robot manipulators based on a path optimization strategy with maximum curvature constraints  (139, Huang et al., 2023).\n\n- Machine Learning Integration: Neural RRT* has been extended to 3D space for efficient path planning, improving performance in complex environments  (101, Jia et al., 2022). Additionally, reinforcement learning has been incorporated into RRT algorithms (LM-RRT) to solve path planning in narrow environments  (123, Liu et al., 2023).\n\n- Sparse Waypoint Optimization: The BPOMP (Boundary Point Optimization with Minimal Perturbation) approach works with sparsely spaced waypoints, finding and optimizing the closest positions to obstacles along continuous paths  (106, Sun et al., 2022).\n\n- Multi-Trajectory Optimization: MPOT (Motion Planning via Optimal Transport) performs well in narrow passages by independently updating each waypoint across all trajectories  (129, Le et al., 2023).\n\n- Improved Optimality: Techniques have been developed to improve the optimality of paths generated by multiple-RRT, addressing the issue of suboptimal routes in configuration space  (156, Lee et al., 2024).\n\n- Dynamic Constraints: NoD-RRT utilizes neural network-based cost functions and nonlinear robot dynamics to plan trajectories while considering key dynamical limits  (157, Epureanu et al., 2024).\n\n- Connectivity-Aware Planning: CAPER builds on RRT with algorithmic modifications in both the planner and collision detector to address challenges in connectivity-aware path planning in realistic spaces  (58, Feng et al., 2019).\n\n- Adaptive Sampling: ADD-RRT framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) to identify local configuration space types, accelerating expansion around obstacles and through narrow passages  (93, Cai et al., 2021).\n\n- Probabilistic Mapping: Advanced RRT algorithms have been combined with probabilistic grid mapping of obstacle information for local path planning and obstacle avoidance  (96, Meng et al., 2021).\n\nThese optimization and refinement methods collectively aim to address the limitations of traditional RRT algorithms in narrow passages and complex environments, improving path quality, computational efficiency, and adaptability to various challenging scenarios.\n\nReferences:\n1.

However, they face challenges with temperature sensitivity and static force measurement.\n\nPiezoelectric tactile sensors have emerged as a significant technology in robotic sensing due to their unique properties and capabilities. These sensors operate on the piezoelectric effect, where certain materials generate an electrical charge in response to applied mechanical stress [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. This principle allows for highly sensitive and rapid detection of forces and pressures, making them particularly suitable for dynamic tactile sensing in robotics.\n\nOne of the key advantages of piezoelectric tactile sensors is their excellent sensitivity to small forces and vibrations. This high sensitivity enables robots to detect subtle changes in their environment, which is crucial for tasks requiring fine manipulation or delicate interactions [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. Additionally, piezoelectric sensors boast remarkably fast response times, allowing for real-time feedback in robotic systems. This rapid response is essential for applications where quick adjustments or reactions are necessary, such as in collision avoidance or object grasping tasks.\n\nHowever, piezoelectric tactile sensors also come with certain limitations. One significant drawback is their sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, which can affect the sensor's output and potentially lead to inaccurate readings in environments with varying temperatures [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. This temperature dependency may require additional compensation mechanisms in robotic systems operating in diverse thermal conditions.\n\nAnother challenge associated with piezoelectric sensors is their inability to measure static forces effectively. These sensors excel at detecting dynamic changes in force but struggle to maintain a consistent output under constant pressure. This characteristic can be a limitation in scenarios where robots need to assess and maintain steady contact forces over extended periods [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nDespite these challenges, piezoelectric tactile sensors continue to be a valuable tool in robotics due to their unique combination of high sensitivity and rapid response. Ongoing research and development in this field aim to address the existing limitations and further enhance the capabilities of these sensors for robotic applications.\n\nTriboelectric (TENG-based) Tactile Sensors for Robots\nTLDR: Triboelectric tactile sensors offer self-powered operation and high sensitivity, but face challenges with durability and environmental interference. They show promise for soft robotics and human-machine interfaces due to their flexibility and low cost.\n\nTriboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based tactile sensors have emerged as a promising technology for robotic applications, offering unique advantages in self-powered operation and sensitivity. These sensors operate on the principle of contact electrification and electrostatic induction, generating electrical signals in response to mechanical stimuli [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nOne of the primary advantages of TENG-based tactile sensors is their ability to function without an external power source. This self-powered characteristic makes them particularly attractive for use in autonomous robots and wearable devices, where energy efficiency is crucial [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. Additionally, these sensors exhibit high sensitivity to a wide range of pressures and forces, enabling robots to detect and respond to subtle environmental changes.\n\nThe flexibility and adaptability of TENG-based sensors make them well-suited for soft robotics applications. Their ability to conform to various surfaces and maintain functionality under deformation allows for integration into complex robotic structures and human-machine interfaces [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. Moreover, the relatively low cost and simple fabrication processes of these sensors contribute to their potential for widespread adoption in robotics.\n\nHowever, TENG-based tactile sensors also face several challenges. Durability remains a concern, as repeated mechanical stress can degrade the sensor's performance over time [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. Environmental factors such as humidity and temperature can also affect the triboelectric effect, potentially leading to inconsistent readings in varying conditions.\n\nAnother limitation is the susceptibility of TENG sensors to electromagnetic interference, which can impact their accuracy in certain environments [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. This issue may require additional shielding or signal processing techniques in robotic applications where electromagnetic noise is prevalent.\n\nDespite these challenges, ongoing research in materials science and sensor design continues to improve the performance and reliability of TENG-based tactile sensors. Their unique combination of self-powered operation, high sensitivity, and flexibility positions them as a promising technology for advancing tactile sensing in robotics, particularly in areas where energy efficiency and adaptability are paramount.\n\n"}

This gap poses significant challenges for transferring policies trained in simulation to physical robots, often resulting in poor real-world performance.\n\nThe reality gap is a fundamental challenge in transferring robotics systems from simulation to the real world (5, Ta\u00efga et al., 2018)  (59, Zhang et al., 2018). This gap manifests as a significant discrepancy between the performance of policies trained in simulation and their effectiveness when deployed on physical robots  (1, Collins, 0). The issue is so severe that it often prevents simulated solutions from transferring perfectly to reality, making it unsuitable to train many tasks directly on physical robots (5, Ta\u00efga et al., 2018).\n\nThe reality gap is particularly critical for certain aspects of robotics, such as actuators in legged robots  (158, Masuda et al., 2022). Even when simulation parameters are carefully tuned to match a specific trajectory, there remains a possibility of a reality gap when the policy is executed on the actual robot  (158, Masuda et al., 2022). This highlights the complexity of the problem and the difficulty in creating simulations that accurately represent all aspects of the real world.\n\nResearchers have recognized the reality gap as a long-standing challenge in robot learning, particularly in the context of sim-to-real transfer  (201, Schuurmans et al., 2024). The failure of policies trained in simulators to transfer effectively to real robots underscores the significance of this issue and the need for innovative solutions to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(5, Ta\u00efga et al., 2018) | n_citations: 86 | Sim-to-Real Transfer with Neural-Augmented Robot Simulation ]: \nBecause of the \"reality gap,\" policies trained in simulation often perform poorly when deployed on a real system...

These challenges lead to discrepancies between simulated and real-world performance, affecting the transferability of learned policies.\n\nThe transfer of robotics systems from simulation to reality is significantly hindered by the challenges in accurately modeling and simulating real-world conditions. One of the primary issues is the presence of modeling errors, which can cause controllers that perform well in simulation to fail when applied to physical robots  (18, Medvet et al., 2021). This discrepancy is particularly pronounced in complex systems such as soft robotics, where modeling and control have proven to be notably difficult, resulting in significant training-to-reality gaps  (24, Campinoti et al., 2023).\n\nThe sensitivity of robotic systems to simulation parameters further complicates the training of dynamics policies, especially when the controller for the real-world robot is unknown  (19, Yokoyama et al., 2022). This sensitivity can lead to model errors that not only cause degraded policies but also often drastically bias the learning process  (36, Neumann et al., 2013). The challenge is exacerbated in tasks involving complex contact dynamics, such as industrial assembly with tight insertions, where accurate simulation becomes increasingly difficult  (26, Tomizuka et al., 2023).\n\nThe disparity between simulated and real-world environments is particularly stark when considering the structural simplicity of simulations compared to the highly complicated real-world scenarios  (46, Tai et al., 2017). This fundamental difference constitutes a central challenge in directly transferring trained models to real robots. Moreover, system mismatches in various aspects have been identified as constraining factors that limit the performance of policies when deployed on physical robots  (57, Wang et al., 2018).\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have developed frameworks for running robots in both real and simulated settings, allowing for the evaluation and improvement of simulators at conceptual and results levels  (3, NULL, 2014). However, the difficulty in training robots to accomplish diverse tasks through a single control policy via reinforcement learning remains a significant hurdle, particularly for highly dynamic locomotion maneuvers where adapting to real robot dynamics is crucial to prevent drift and maintain effective gaits  (200, Levine et al., 2024).\n\nThe complexity of these modeling and simulation challenges often makes learning with physical robots insurmountably difficult without careful task setups  (58, Bergstra et al., 2018), highlighting the need for innovative approaches to bridge the gap between simulation and reality in robotics research and development.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(58, Bergstra et al., 2018) | n_citations: 140 | Benchmarking Reinforcement Learning Algorithms on Real-World Robots ]: \nMoreover, without careful task setups, learning with physical robots can be insurmountably difficult.\n\n\n\nPerformance Issues\nTLDR: Performance issues when transferring robotics systems from simulation to reality stem from the reality gap, leading to poor real-world execution of policies trained in simulation. These challenges are exacerbated by the complexity of real-world environments and the difficulty in accurately modeling robot dynamics and interactions.\n\nThe transfer of robotics systems from simulation to the real world often results in significant performance degradation due to the reality gap  (12, Liu et al., 2020)  (27, Ju et al., 2023). This discrepancy between simulated and real-world environments can lead to catastrophic failures when deploying policies trained in simulation onto physical robots  (121, Ibarz et al., 2021). The performance issues are particularly pronounced in complex tasks involving vision-guided locomotion, where asynchronous multi-modal observations in real robots create a substantial sim-to-real gap  (16, Imai et al., 2021).\n\nOne of the primary challenges is the inability of simulators to capture the full complexity of the real world, leading to policies that fail to generalize well when transferred  (147, Goldberg et al., 2022). This issue is exacerbated in scenarios involving soft robotics or less accurate position controllers, where larger discrepancies between simulation and reality can significantly degrade the performance of transferred policies  (188, Guist et al., 2023).\n\nThe reality gap also poses significant challenges for deep learning applications in robotics, particularly in terms of sample efficiency and safety in real-world robot applications  (112, Kober et al., 2020). Training directly on physical robots is often intractable due to the high cost, potential safety risks, and time-consuming nature of data collection  (12, Liu et al., 2020)  (14, Dasagi et al., 2020).\n\nTo address these performance issues, researchers have developed various approaches. Some techniques focus on evolving controllers that exhibit robust behaviors in simulation, aiming to transfer well onto real robots  (2, Doncieux et al., 2013). Others propose feedback structures for detecting and preserving critical experiences during testing to mitigate errors caused by the simulator-reality gap  (206, Yang et al., 2024).\n\nDespite these efforts, bridging the reality gap remains a challenging problem  (12, Liu et al., 2020). The mismatch between simulation and reality continues to hinder the direct transfer of trained policies to real-world robots  (107, Kim et al., 2020). As a result, researchers are exploring methods to combine simulation-based learning with real-world adaptation to improve the performance of transferred policies  (210, Shi et al., 2024).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Bridging the reality gap is still a challenging problem.\n\n2. [(27, Ju et al., 2023) | n_citations: 1 | Sim-to-Real Policy and Reward Transfer with Adaptive Forward Dynamics Model ]: \nHowever, transferring the simulation policy directly to the real robot is risky and the performance of robot control is usually very poor because of the gap between simulation and real world.\n\n3.

[(147, Goldberg et al., 2022) | n_citations: 167 | DayDreamer: World Models for Physical Robot Learning ]: \nDeep reinforcement learning is a common approach to robot learning but requires a large amount of trial and error to learn, limiting its deployment in the physical world. As a consequence, many advances in robot learning rely on simulators.

However, the sim-to-real gap and low sample efficiency still limit the skill transfer... Meanwhile, training directly in the real robot from scratch fails to take advantage of the simulation environment.\n\n\n\nSafety Concerns\nTLDR: Transferring robotics systems from simulation to reality raises significant safety concerns due to the reality gap. Policies learned in simulation may exhibit unsafe behaviors when deployed on real robots, potentially causing damage to the robot or its surroundings.\n\nThe transition of robotic systems from simulation to real-world environments introduces critical safety challenges that cannot be overlooked. One of the primary concerns is that policies trained in simulation may not consistently generate safe behaviors when implemented on physical robots  (20, Kaushik et al., 2022). This discrepancy arises from the inevitable reality gap between simulated and real-world conditions, which can lead to unexpected and potentially dangerous robot behaviors during real-world policy adaptation.\n\nThe safety risks associated with sim-to-real transfer are particularly concerning because they can result in physical harm. During the process of adapting simulation-trained policies to real-world scenarios, there is a risk that the robot may damage itself or cause harm to its surroundings  (20, Kaushik et al., 2022). This highlights the need for robust safety measures and careful consideration when deploying simulation-trained policies on physical robotic systems.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of insufficient training in simulators compounds these safety concerns. Policies that have not been adequately trained or tested in simulation may exhibit poor performance or, more critically, dangerous behaviors when transfer learning is executed on physical robotic systems  (139, Yu et al., 2021). This underscores the importance of thorough and comprehensive simulation training, as well as the development of methods to ensure safe exploration and adaptation in real-world environments.\n\nThe safety challenges in sim-to-real transfer emphasize the need for advanced safety protocols and robust testing frameworks to mitigate risks when transitioning from simulated to physical robotic systems. Addressing these safety concerns is crucial for the responsible development and deployment of robotics technologies in real-world applications.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(20, Kaushik et al., 2022) | n_citations: 8 | SafeAPT: Safe Simulation-to-Real Robot Learning Using Diverse Policies Learned in Simulation ]: \ndue to the inevitable reality gap between the simulation and the real world, a policy learned in the simulation may not always generate a safe behaviour on the real robot.

These include transfer learning methods, fine-tuning strategies, and simulation-based training approaches that aim to bridge the reality gap and improve real-world robot performance.\n\n1. Transfer Learning Techniques: A variety of transfer learning approaches are being developed to achieve successful transfer from simulation to real robots  (11, Misimi et al., 2020). These techniques aim to leverage knowledge gained in simulation to improve real-world performance.\n\n2. Simulation-to-Real Transfer for Legged Robots: Researchers have demonstrated success in training legged robotic systems in simulation and transferring the learned policies to reality  (7, Kadian et al., 2019). This approach shows promise for complex locomotion tasks.\n\n3. Modular Deep Reinforcement Learning: A modular deep reinforcement learning method has been proposed to transfer models trained in simulation to real-world robotic tasks. This approach has shown significant improvements in accuracy for visually-guided robot reaching tasks  (4, Corke et al., 2016).\n\n4. Fine-tuning on Real Robots: While learning in simulation offers advantages, some amount of fine-tuning on the real robot is often required for effective transfer learning  (6, Baar et al., 2018). This approach helps bridge the gap between simulated and real-world performance.\n\n5. Manipulation Policy Transfer: Promising work has been done in training manipulation policies in simulation and transferring them to real robots  (71, Srinivasan et al., 2019). This approach is particularly relevant for robotic manipulation tasks.\n\n6. Two-Step Transfer Process: A common approach involves first generating behaviors in simulation and then using them as targets to train robots directly in the real world  (202, Garattoni et al., 2024). While effective, this method can be time-consuming and requires the use of physical robots in the design process.\n\n7. Environment Modification: Some researchers have focused on modifying the simulated environment to simplify challenges related to closed-kinematic chains, facilitating easier sim-to-real transfer  (209, Gupta et al., 2024).\n\n8. Sim-to-Sim Transfer: This method has shown efficiency in reducing training time and evaluating the robustness of approaches before deploying learned models on real-robot platforms  (166, Kasaei et al., 2022).\n\n9. State Estimation and Sim2Real Methods: Transferring policies learned in powerful simulators to real robots can be achieved through accurate state estimation or by employing state-of-the-art Sim2Real methods  (66, Srinivasa et al., 2018).\n\n10. Direct Deployment: Some researchers have successfully trained control policies in virtual simulation and then deployed the learned models directly to real robots  (88, Long et al., 2020). This approach has gained traction in recent years as simulation fidelity has improved.\n\nDespite these advancements, it's important to note that even highly accurate simulators might not accurately model all the relevant dynamics of a robotic system  (67, Plessis et al., 2018). This ongoing challenge emphasizes the need for continued research and development in sim-to-real transfer methods.\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "6453c86c72949978fb8db5405b48c923", "answer_text": "Evidence of LLMs in Robot Planning\nTLDR: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in robot planning tasks, demonstrating capabilities in high-level reasoning, task decomposition, and natural language instruction understanding. Researchers have successfully integrated LLMs with robotics systems to enhance planning, decision-making, and execution of complex tasks.\n\nNumerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in robot planning tasks, showcasing their potential to revolutionize the field of robotics. LLMs have exhibited remarkable abilities in facilitating high-level reasoning, logical reasoning, and robotics planning  (67, Darvish et al., 2024). These models have been successfully applied to generate reward functions for low-level robot actions, effectively bridging the gap between high-level planning and low-level robot control  (67, Darvish et al., 2024).\n\nThe integration of LLMs into robotics has led to significant progress in various robot tasks  (25, Ge et al., 2023). Researchers have found that LLMs can provide high-level planning and reasoning skills, enabling the control of interactive robot behavior in multimodal environments  (23, Zhao et al., 2023). This capability has been particularly useful in task and motion planning (TAMP), where LLMs can bypass the computational burden of explicit optimization processes in classical TAMP methods  (26, Huang et al., 2023).\n\nNotable advancements in LLM applications for robotics include PaLM-E, a single large embodied multimodal model that can address various embodied reasoning tasks across multiple embodiments  (8, Yu et al., 2023). Similarly, SayCan has demonstrated the ability to incorporate real-world experience into LLMs through the value function of pretrained skills, enabling the execution of abstract, long-term commands on robots  (38, Qi et al., 2023).\n\nLLMs have shown promise in translating natural language into robot action sequences for complex tasks  (18, Chen et al., 2023)  (30, You et al., 2023). Researchers have successfully used LLMs to plan robot manipulation tasks  (52, Cai et al., 2023) and extract actionable knowledge for robot manipulation in the form of reasoning and planning (9, Fei-Fei et al., 2023).\n\nThe integration of LLMs with robotics has enabled zero-shot performance on various tasks  (39, Sun et al., 2023). For instance, ProgPrompt leverages LLMs' strengths in both world knowledge and programming language understanding to generate situated task plans that can be directly executed in robotic task planning  (24, Goyal et al., 2023).\n\nResearchers have also explored using LLMs as a \"robotic brain\" to unify egocentric memory and control  (29, Mai et al., 2023). This approach integrates multiple multimodal language models for robotic tasks, utilizing a zero-shot learning approach with an embodied LLM at its core to maintain egocentric memory and control the robot.\n\nThe application of LLMs in robotics has extended to various domains, including daily tasks  (49, Chen et al., 2023), interactive planning for partially observable tasks  (51, Jain et al., 2023), and natural language interfaces for service robots  (10, Stone et al., 2023). These advancements have demonstrated the potential of LLMs to enhance human-robot interactions and autonomous task planning  (63, Wang et al., 2023).\n\nDespite the promising results, it's important to note that the integration of robotics and LLMs is still in its early stages  (39, Sun et al., 2023). Researchers continue to explore ways to improve the feasibility and correctness of LLM-generated task plans  (49, Chen et al., 2023) and to develop more sophisticated approaches for leveraging LLMs in robotic systems  (71, Cano et al., 2024).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence strongly suggests that LLMs can be effectively applied to robot planning tasks, offering significant improvements in natural language understanding, task decomposition, and high-level reasoning for complex robotic operations.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These capabilities enable more flexible and intuitive human-robot interactions, as well as improved performance in complex, long-horizon tasks.\n\nLLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in enhancing robot planning tasks, offering several key advantages:\n\n1. Natural Language Understanding: LLMs excel at comprehending and generating natural language instructions, enabling more intuitive human-robot interactions  (63, Wang et al., 2023)  (15, Gan et al., 2023). This capability allows robots to understand complex, high-level commands and translate them into actionable plans (9, Fei-Fei et al., 2023)  (3, Zeng et al., 2022).\n\n2. Task Planning and Decomposition: LLMs have shown proficiency in high-level task planning, breaking down complex, long-horizon tasks into manageable subtasks  (17, Firoozi et al., 2023)  (70, Bhat et al., 2024). This ability enables robots to handle more sophisticated and open-ended tasks effectively.\n\n3. Common Sense Reasoning: Trained on vast datasets, LLMs possess a wealth of common sense knowledge that can be leveraged for robot planning  (48, Wang et al., 2023)  (62, Ai et al., 2023). This knowledge helps robots understand typical layouts of environments and object locations, enhancing their ability to navigate and manipulate objects in human-centric spaces.\n\n4. Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning: LLMs demonstrate impressive zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities, allowing robots to adapt to new tasks without extensive retraining  (39, Sun et al., 2023)  (5, Tremblay et al., 2022). This flexibility is particularly valuable for robots operating in dynamic environments or facing novel challenges.\n\n5. Multimodal Integration: LLMs can be effectively integrated with other AI techniques and modalities, such as computer vision and reinforcement learning  (7, Levine et al., 2022)  (55, Weber et al., 2023). This integration enables more robust and versatile robotic systems capable of handling a wide range of tasks and environments.\n\n6. Feedback and Refinement: LLMs can provide feedback on robot performance and help refine task plans, leading to improved execution and learning over time  (68, Abdulkarim et al., 2024)  (27, Min et al., 2023).\n\n7. Grounding Language in Robot Actions: LLMs facilitate the grounding of natural language instructions in robot actions and observations, bridging the gap between high-level commands and low-level control  (80, Nair et al., 2021)  (74, Dey et al., 2018).\n\n8. Heuristic Strategies: LLMs can serve as effective heuristic strategies within search algorithms, enhancing the efficiency of robot planning processes  (66, Shi et al., 2024).\n\nWhile the integration of LLMs in robotics is still in its early stages  (39, Sun et al., 2023), ongoing research continues to improve the feasibility and correctness of LLM-generated task plans  (49, Chen et al., 2023).

{"case_id": "3a19520deab02250c7384cfbc79fcbff", "answer_text": "Performance Comparison\nTLDR: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms generally require more computational resources and memory than traditional methods. However, some PQC algorithms, particularly lattice-based ones, show promising performance that can be comparable or even superior to conventional cryptography in certain aspects.\n\nThe transition to post-quantum cryptography brings significant changes in performance characteristics compared to traditional cryptographic methods. Generally, PQC algorithms demand more computational resources and memory  (31, Kumar, 2022)  (40, Costa et al., 2022). They typically require more CPU cycles for basic operations and consume substantially more runtime memory than classical cryptographic algorithms  (31, Kumar, 2022)  (22, Science et al., 2021).\n\nHowever, the performance landscape is not uniformly negative for PQC. Some algorithms, particularly lattice-based ones like Kyber and NewHope, have shown promising results. For instance, these algorithms require fewer CPU cycles for key generation compared to RSA-1024  (17, Tujner et al., 2020). Kyber and Dilithium have demonstrated key creation times that are faster than RSA and only slightly slower than ECC  (18, Fiolhais et al., 2020).\n\nRecent studies have provided more nuanced insights into PQC performance. Hauser et al. found that HQC and Kyber perform comparably to current state-of-the-art algorithms, while Dilithium and Falcon are even faster  (46, Hauser et al., 2023). Notably, at higher NIST security levels, some PQC algorithms outperformed all currently used algorithms, suggesting that post-quantum TLS could be suitable for adoption in today's systems  (46, Hauser et al., 2023).\n\nIn the context of specific applications, Kyber512 has been identified as an ideal Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi devices, with Falcon-512 and Dilithium2 emerging as the best signature schemes for these platforms  (47, Hanna et al., 2023). However, it's important to note that performance can vary depending on the specific use case and implementation. For instance, while Kyber doesn't introduce significant overhead in some scenarios, post-quantum signature schemes can sometimes result in impractical latency times and lower throughputs  (58, Cebe et al., 2023).\n\nWhen comparing post-quantum algorithms in network protocols, interesting patterns emerge. In TCP/TLS and QUIC implementations, transitioning to post-quantum authentication generally induces at least one more packet overhead, except when using Falcon 512  (55, Zhou et al., 2023). QUIC tends to outperform TCP/TLS when using post-quantum lattice-based ciphers like Dilithium and Falcon  (55, Zhou et al., 2023).\n\nIt's worth noting that while PQC algorithms generally require more resources, their impact on system performance can sometimes be less severe than expected. For example, one study observed that battery runtime was not significantly affected when migrating from conventional cryptography to PQC on an IoT edge device (32, Sch\u00f6ffel et al., 2022).\n\nIn conclusion, while PQC algorithms generally demand more computational resources and memory, their performance characteristics are diverse. Some PQC algorithms, particularly lattice-based ones, show promising performance that can be comparable or even superior to conventional cryptography in certain aspects. As research and implementation techniques continue to evolve, we can expect further improvements in PQC performance.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Furthermore, we observed that battery runtime is not significantly affected by migrating from conventional cryptography to PQC.\n\n\n\nEnergy Consumption Comparison\nTLDR: Post-quantum cryptography algorithms generally consume more energy than traditional methods, but the extent varies widely depending on the specific algorithm and implementation. Hardware optimizations and co-design approaches can significantly reduce energy consumption for some PQC algorithms.\n\nPost-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms typically consume more energy than their classical counterparts, which is a critical consideration for resource-constrained devices and energy-efficient systems. The energy consumption of PQC algorithms varies significantly depending on the specific algorithm, implementation, and hardware platform.\n\nComparative studies have shown that some PQC algorithms can be substantially more energy-intensive than traditional methods. For instance, the Supersingular Isogeny Based Diffie Hellman (SIDH) post-quantum key exchange algorithm has been found to consume 37 to 47 times more energy compared to Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) at equivalent security levels  (23, Roma et al., 2021). This significant energy overhead highlights the challenges in adopting certain PQC algorithms in energy-constrained environments.\n\nHowever, the energy consumption landscape for PQC is not uniformly negative. Some lattice-based algorithms, which include Kyber and Dilithium, show more promising results. A study on an ARM Cortex-M4 platform revealed that different PQC algorithms introduce varying amounts of power consumption, with up to 47% variation among them  (43, Fournaris et al., 2023). This variability suggests that careful algorithm selection can mitigate some of the energy consumption concerns.\n\nHardware optimizations and co-design approaches have shown significant potential in reducing the energy consumption of PQC algorithms. A lattice cryptography processor with configurable parameters demonstrated up to two orders of magnitude energy savings through architectural optimizations  (4, Pathak et al., 2019). Similarly, co-design implementations of NewHope, Kyber, and Saber algorithms achieved energy consumption reductions by factors of up to 9.5, 7.7, and 2.1 respectively, compared to pure software implementations on RISC-V  (7, Fritzmann et al., 2020).\n\nInterestingly, the energy efficiency of PQC algorithms can vary depending on the device type. While PQC ciphers generally consume greater power than RSA on laptops and desktops, they have been shown to consume comparable power on resource-constrained devices like Raspberry Pis  (38, Hines et al., 2022). This suggests that the relative energy efficiency of PQC algorithms may be more favorable in certain IoT and edge computing scenarios.\n\nSome novel approaches to post-quantum cryptography have shown promising results in terms of energy efficiency. For example, the HASES (Hybrid Authentication with Short Exponent Sampling) scheme has demonstrated significantly better energy efficiency compared to both post-quantum and traditional signature schemes on resource-constrained devices  (45, Yavuz et al., 2023)  (65, Yavuz et al., 2023).\n\nIt's important to note that energy consumption was not explicitly included as an evaluation criterion in the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process  (23, Roma et al., 2021). This suggests that future research and optimization efforts focused specifically on energy efficiency could lead to substantial improvements in the energy consumption profiles of standardized PQC algorithms.\n\nIn conclusion, while PQC algorithms generally consume more energy than traditional cryptographic methods, the extent of this increase varies widely. Ongoing research in hardware optimizations and novel algorithmic approaches shows promise in mitigating these energy consumption challenges, particularly for resource-constrained devices.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(23, Roma et al., 2021) | n_citations: 9 | Energy Efficiency Analysis of Post-Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms ]: \nUnlike the lightweight cryptography standardization process, energy consumption is not an evaluation criterion for the post-quantum cryptography process... The work in [8] compares the energy consumption of Supersingular Isogeny Based Diffie Hellman (SIDH) post-quantum secure key exchange algorithm against Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman where it was shown that SIDH consumes 37 to 47 times more energy compared to ECDH targeting the same security levels.\n\n2. [(43, Fournaris et al., 2023) | n_citations: 5 | Energy Consumption Evaluation of Post-Quantum TLS 1.3 for Resource-Constrained Embedded Devices ]: \nFrom the performed comparisons and analysis, it can firstly be concluded that when dealing with resource-constrained systems, like the ARM Cortex-M4, each PQC algorithm introduces a different amount of power consumption with up to 47% variation... This power consumption along with the PQC algorithms' execution time influences the PQC algorithms' energy consumption and eventually the TLS 1.3 implementation that uses it.\n\n3. [(4, Pathak et al., 2019) | n_citations: 42 | 2.3 An Energy-Efficient Configurable Lattice Cryptography Processor for the Quantum-Secure Internet of Things ]: \nModern public key protocols, such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), will be rendered insecure by Shor's algorithm [1] when large-scale quantum computers are built...

For the ASIC implementation, the energy consumption was reduced by factors of up to 9.5 for NewHope, 7.7 for Kyber, and 2.1 for Saber.\n\n5. [(38, Hines et al., 2022) | n_citations: 2 | Post-Quantum Cipher Power Analysis in Lightweight Devices ]: \nOur results show that PQC ciphers can be feasible in the resource-constrained devices (simulated with varying Raspberry Pis in our case); while PQCs consume greater power than the classical cipher of RSA for laptop and desktop, they consume comparable power for the Raspberry Pis.\n\n6.

HASES is even 16* more energy efficient than SchnorrQ [3], which is neither PQ nor FS.\n\n7. [(65, Yavuz et al., 2023) | n_citations: 0 | Post-Quantum Hybrid Digital Signatures with Hardware-Support for Digital Twins ]: \nPQ-HASES and LA-HASES are 40* and 99* more energy efficient than BLISS and Ed25519 which are the only feasible PQ and conventional-secure alternatives on the 8-bit device, respectively.\n\n\n\nImpact of Hardware Optimizations\nTLDR: Hardware optimizations can significantly enhance the performance and energy efficiency of post-quantum cryptography algorithms. While dedicated hardware accelerators offer substantial improvements, software optimizations and clever use of existing hardware features can also yield notable benefits.\n\nHardware optimizations play a crucial role in improving the performance and energy efficiency of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms. One approach that has shown promising results is the integration of dedicated hardware components. For instance, Fanucci et al. introduced a Post-Quantum Arithmetic Logic Unit embedded directly in the RISC-V processor pipeline, achieving substantial speed-ups and energy reductions with minimal area overhead  (21, Fanucci et al., 2021). Similarly, Pagliarini et al. demonstrated that hardware implementations of NIST PQC algorithms can be hundreds of times faster than their software counterparts  (12, Pagliarini et al., 2020).\n\nHowever, the necessity of dedicated hardware accelerators for efficient PQC implementation on energy-constrained devices has been challenged. Lauer et al. showed that edge devices running various PQC algorithms can achieve low energy consumption without specialized hardware accelerators  (24, Lauer et al., 2021). This suggests that software optimizations and clever use of existing hardware features can also yield significant improvements.\n\nIndeed, several studies have explored ways to optimize PQC performance using existing hardware capabilities. Wiesmaier et al. proposed reusing co-processors optimized for big-number arithmetic to accelerate PQC operations without hardware modifications  (44, Wiesmaier et al., 2023). Koteshwara et al. achieved substantial performance improvements for CRYSTALS-Kyber KEM through vectorization of time-consuming primitives  (15, Koteshwara et al., 2020). Similarly, Peng et al. reported performance boosts for lattice-based cryptography using 256-bit advanced vector instructions (AVX2)  (49, Peng et al., 2023).\n\nEmerging computing paradigms also offer potential for highly efficient PQC implementations. Bellizia et al. suggested that approximate computing and in-memory computing could be leveraged to achieve efficient hardware implementations of PQC primitives  (26, Bellizia et al., 2021). However, it's important to note that PQC algorithms often require large memory footprints and involve highly repetitive computations, which can pose challenges for efficient hardware implementations  (51, Kim et al., 2023).\n\nTo address evolving security demands, Shafique et al. proposed a run-time configurable and unified hardware accelerator for PQC algorithms, allowing switching between different schemes and security levels with low configuration overhead (30, Sha\ufb01que et al., 2021). This approach aims to provide high performance efficiency at a low area cost.\n\nWhile hardware optimizations can significantly enhance PQC performance, it's worth noting that the continued increase in classical computing power may help offset some of the computational overhead associated with PQC  (14, indsay, 2020). This suggests that the implementation barriers posed by PQC's computational demands may decrease over time, even without specific optimizations.\n\nIn conclusion, hardware optimizations offer significant potential for improving the performance and energy efficiency of PQC algorithms. While dedicated hardware accelerators can provide substantial benefits, software optimizations and clever use of existing hardware features can also yield notable improvements, potentially making PQC more accessible for a wide range of devices and applications.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Both algorithms benefit from ongoing hardware optimizations to enhance their efficiency and suitability for various applications.\n\nKyber and Dilithium, two prominent post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, have shown promising results in terms of performance and energy efficiency. Recent studies indicate that these lattice-based algorithms are competitive with, and in some cases superior to, current state-of-the-art cryptographic methods  (46, Hauser et al., 2023). Specifically, Kyber has emerged as an ideal Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) for resource-constrained devices such as those using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi  (47, Hanna et al., 2023).\n\nIn terms of performance, Kyber and Dilithium have demonstrated key creation times that are faster than RSA and only slightly slower than ECC  (18, Fiolhais et al., 2020). This suggests that these PQC algorithms can be implemented without significant performance penalties in many applications. Notably, at higher NIST security levels, these algorithms have even outperformed all currently used algorithms, indicating their suitability for adoption in today's systems  (46, Hauser et al., 2023).\n\nDilithium, in particular, has shown impressive results in comparative evaluations. It has been found to be the fastest among post-quantum signature schemes, except for UOV, and boasts the lowest energy consumption  (69, Shim, 2024). These characteristics make Dilithium particularly advantageous for low-power scenarios (53, Mili\u02c7cevi\u00b4c et al., 2023). However, it's worth noting that Dilithium requires the largest memory among the compared schemes, which may be a consideration for memory-constrained devices  (69, Shim, 2024).\n\nThe integration of Kyber and Dilithium into existing protocols has also shown promising results. Some studies have demonstrated that incorporating these PQC algorithms into the TLS protocol can actually reduce power, time, and energy consumption compared to classic TLS implementations  (56, Guo et al., 2023). This suggests that the transition to post-quantum cryptography may not necessarily come at the cost of increased resource consumption in all cases.\n\nHowever, the performance of Kyber and Dilithium can be further enhanced through hardware optimizations. Current hardware implementations of these algorithms employ various methods to improve their performance  (70, Hoang et al., 2024). While dedicated hardware accelerators can offer significant speed improvements  (54, Aikata et al., 2023), it's important to note that even without specialized hardware, these algorithms can achieve competitive performance on a wide range of devices.\n\nIn conclusion, Kyber and Dilithium represent promising post-quantum cryptographic solutions that offer competitive performance and energy efficiency. Their ability to outperform traditional algorithms in certain scenarios, coupled with ongoing hardware optimization efforts, positions them as strong candidates for widespread adoption in the post-quantum era.\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "57f1dc7fb4c25e0cceb2ae6e8653b795", "answer_text": "Measurement Strategies and Frameworks\nTLDR: Effective measurement of software engineering process improvements relies on structured frameworks and strategies. These approaches typically involve setting goals, defining metrics, and conducting assessments to evaluate and improve software development practices.\n\nSoftware process improvement (SPI) is a methodical approach to enhance software development practices, encompassing understanding, defining, measuring, and optimizing processes (48, \u4fee, 2001). To effectively measure these improvements in real-world settings, various strategies and frameworks have been developed and implemented.\n\nOne notable framework is the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) paradigm, which generates a set of goals that are defined into quantifiable questions and specify metrics to be collected on the software development and maintenance process and product  (9, Aor. et al., 1985). This approach allows organizations to characterize, evaluate, predict, and motivate improvements based on data analysis.\n\nAssessment strategies play a crucial role in measuring SPI effectiveness. Unterkalmsteiner et al. identified seven distinct evaluation strategies, with \"Pre-Post Comparison\" being the most common, applied in 49% of the studies they reviewed  (3, Unterkalmsteiner et al., 2012). Quality, cost, and schedule were the most frequently measured attributes, with metrics such as productivity during development phases and defect rates per phase being commonly used.\n\nSeveral established frameworks guide the measurement process. The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination (SPICE) focus on defining and measuring processes and practices to achieve quality  (131, Rath et al., 2012). These frameworks typically involve steps such as evaluating the current process, identifying improvements, implementing changes, and re-evaluating  (144, Bjarnason, 2013).\n\nAn important aspect of measurement is the concept of implementation success, which refers to the extent to which SPI initiatives lead to actual changes in software engineering practices  (59, Sandberg et al., 2004). This metric is considered fundamental, as without successful implementation, overall SPI success is impossible to achieve.\n\nSome researchers advocate for a balanced approach that combines stakeholder perceptions with process prescriptions to enhance the specificity, comparability, and accuracy of software process assessments  (93, Mathiassen et al., 2009). This method aims to provide a more comprehensive view of the improvement process.\n\nNewer methodologies, such as the Multicriteria Decision Aid - Constructivist (MCDA-C), offer a constructivist approach to SPI assessment. This method helps visualize criteria based on decision-makers' values, enabling managers to focus on and prioritize process improvement actions  (128, Scheid et al., 2012).\n\nIn summary, measuring software engineering process improvements in real-world settings requires a structured approach that typically involves setting clear goals, defining relevant metrics, and conducting regular assessments. The choice of framework or strategy should align with the organization's specific needs and context, ensuring that the measurement process provides actionable insights for continuous improvement.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The methodology makes it possible to visualize the criteria that must be taken into account according to the decision-makers' values in the process improvement actions... This process helped the manager of the company studied to focus on and prioritize process improvement actions.\n\n\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Metrics\nTLDR: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics are essential for measuring software engineering process improvements. These include measures related to quality, cost, schedule, productivity, and customer satisfaction, which provide objective data for decision-making and continuous improvement.\n\n- Quality Metrics: Quality is the most frequently measured attribute in software process improvement, used in 62% of studies  (3, Unterkalmsteiner et al., 2012). Common quality metrics include defect rates per development phase and the number of bugs or defects found in a product  (94, Umarji et al., 2009).\n\n- Cost and Schedule Metrics: These are the second and third most measured attributes, with cost being measured in 41% of studies and schedule in 18%  (3, Unterkalmsteiner et al., 2012). These metrics help track the efficiency of the development process over time  (18, Paulish et al., 1994).\n\n- Productivity Metrics: These include measures such as productivity during development phases  (3, Unterkalmsteiner et al., 2012) and development-oriented metrics like commits authored, file additions/deletions/modifications  (179, Symeonidis et al., 2020).\n\n- Process Metrics: These measure effort and effectiveness, providing quick feedback on defect containment, productivity, and other desirable properties throughout development  (94, Umarji et al., 2009).\n\n- Customer Satisfaction Metrics: Product-related metrics that can be tied to customer satisfaction, often representing objectively verifiable properties  (94, Umarji et al., 2009).\n\n- Test Metrics: These assist in improving the software development process by providing objective evidence of process change initiatives  (100, Bradshaw, 2009).\n\n- Performance Measures: Organizations can define a set of performance measures to observe software process improvement over time  (15, Paulish, 1993).\n\nIt's important to note that while a comprehensive set of metrics can provide valuable insights, some experts recommend limiting the number of measures to reduce the complexity of collecting, analyzing, and maintaining performance data  (18, Paulish et al., 1994). The selection of appropriate KPIs and metrics should align with the organization's specific goals and context, enabling objective and quantitative evaluation of software processes  (178, Springer et al., 2020). These measurements provide organizations with the objective information needed to make informed decisions that impact their business performance  (102, Rocha et al., 2010).\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(102, Rocha et al., 2010) | n_citations: 22 | Establishing a Well-Founded Conceptualization about Software Measurement in High Maturity Levels ]: \nSoftware measurement is a key process for software process improvement. Measurement provides organizations with the objective information they need to make informed decisions that impact their business performance.\n\n\n\nChallenges and Considerations in Measurement\nTLDR: Measuring software engineering process improvements faces numerous challenges, including resource constraints, implementation variability, and the difficulty of evaluating long-term impacts. Organizations must carefully consider these challenges and adapt their measurement strategies to their specific contexts for effective SPI implementation.\n\nThe measurement of software engineering process improvements in real-world settings presents several significant challenges and considerations that organizations must address for successful implementation. One of the most critical issues is the variability in the effectiveness of SPI implementation across different companies  (50, Hall et al., 2002). This variability often stems from inadequate resourcing and a failure to properly evaluate the impact of SPI initiatives.\n\nA fundamental challenge in SPI measurement is understanding how to implement it successfully, which remains a pressing issue in the field (63, Dyb\u00e5, 2005). Research has identified six critical organizational factors that explain more than 50% of the variance in SPI success, highlighting the complexity of the implementation process. Additionally, organizations, particularly in developing countries, often struggle to achieve desired SPI benefits during early adoption due to a lack of benchmarking initiatives  (197, Jhanjhi et al., 2022).\n\nThe evaluation of SPI effects is another area of controversy among researchers and practitioners  (43, Sciuto et al., 2001). It is extremely challenging to determine if, under what circumstances, and to what extent an assessment approach and its resulting improvement plan have had a direct, significant, and positive impact on company performance. This difficulty in measuring long-term impacts can hinder the justification and continued support for SPI initiatives.\n\nMoreover, the rapidly changing software development landscape presents new challenges for SPI measurement. The modern digital society demands faster deliveries, frequent requirement changes, and lower tolerance for failures  (181, Barcellos, 2020). This shift necessitates a move from traditional to continuous and data-driven development approaches, requiring organizations to adapt their measurement strategies accordingly.\n\nAnother consideration is the selection of appropriate measurement indicators. The assessment of proposed measurement indicators in process improvement models is an ongoing area of research, with efforts to develop methodologies for designing measurement indicator assessment grids  (55, Abran et al., 2003). Organizations must carefully choose which specific advanced measures to use, and determine when and where to apply them for optimal and lasting software process improvement  (8, Smith et al., 1970).\n\nDespite the growing adoption of measurement programs in software development, a large percentage of metrics programs fail  (44, Goethert et al., 2001). This underscores the need for practical advice and guidelines for planning and implementing measurement programs effectively. Organizations should focus on bridging the gap between major software engineering fields and SPI measurement metrics, including effort, schedule, cost, productivity, quality, and customer satisfaction  (197, Jhanjhi et al., 2022).\n\nTo address these challenges, organizations need a good understanding of the factors that can positively influence SPI implementation  (152, Niazi, 2015). This knowledge can help identify strategies for successful SPI initiatives. Additionally, organizations should consider narrowing down their focus to a list of processes that should be improved, rather than attempting to measure everything  (190, Marovic et al., 2021).\n\nIn conclusion, while measuring software engineering process improvements in real-world settings is complex and challenging, it remains crucial for organizational success. By acknowledging these challenges and carefully considering the various factors involved, organizations can develop more effective measurement strategies that align with their specific contexts and goals.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These approaches help organizations evaluate and enhance their development processes, testing practices, and overall software quality.\n\n- Qualitative Studies: Researchers have used qualitative studies to understand complex practices like software testing, leading to process improvement propositions that can reduce development and testing costs while improving software quality  (67, Smolander et al., 2006).\n\n- SPI Event Tracking: A method for eliciting all instances of Software Process Improvement (SPI), termed \"SPI events,\" has been developed to capture both small and informal improvements, particularly useful for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)  (139, Clarke et al., 2013).\n\n- Low-Cost Control Practices: For small organizations, focusing on construction and testing practices can significantly influence process improvement at a low cost  (166, Lima et al., 2017).\n\n- Objective Measurements: SPI implementation can be assessed and improved using objective measurements and available methods and practices, such as analyzing the evolution of improved practices rework during software project development  (105, Peixoto et al., 2010).\n\n- Statistical Data Analysis: Multivariate analysis methods can be applied to quantitatively analyze the effects of process monitoring and design quality assessment on software process improvement  (124, Ichinose et al., 2012).\n\n- Internet-Based Tools: Systems like SEES (Software Engineering Evaluation System) can help manage globally distributed projects by measuring software development status  (70, Ma et al., 2006).\n\n- Fine-Grained Process Analysis: Alternative assessment methods involve analyzing fine-grained processes and their related source code characteristics, potentially offering a less tedious and costly approach to software process assessments  (109, Iida et al., 2010).\n\n- FAME Assessments: These can be used to define measurement goals in software process improvement programs  (49, Abran et al., 2001).\n\n- Unified Evaluation Techniques: Work has been done to identify and evaluate methods for measuring the impact of changes to the software process, aiming to create a unified view that helps analysts select appropriate evaluation techniques for specific tasks  (10, Blum, 1988).\n\n- Evaluation Frameworks: Organizations can use frameworks designed to evaluate the effectiveness of their software processes (156, D\u00edaz et al., 2015).\n\nReferences:\n1.

It enables data-driven decision-making, continuous improvement, and helps organizations overcome implementation challenges, ultimately leading to better software quality and business performance.\n\nThe implementation of effective measurement strategies for software engineering process improvements can significantly contribute to organizational success. Software process improvement (SPI) is recognized as a crucial methodology for enhancing software processes, encompassing understanding, definition, measurement, and optimization of these processes (48, \u4fee, 2001). By providing objective and quantitative evaluations of software processes, measurement enables continuous improvement and learning within organizations  (178, Springer et al., 2020).\n\nOne of the key benefits of measurement is its ability to provide organizations with objective information necessary for making informed decisions that impact their business performance  (102, Rocha et al., 2010). This data-driven approach allows companies to monitor the improvement of their software process assessment methods over time  (42, Hunter et al., 2001), leading to more effective SPI initiatives.\n\nThe impact of measurement on organizational success is particularly evident in the realm of software testing. When used properly, test metrics can provide pragmatic, objective evidence of process change initiatives, helping organizations prove the effectiveness of their process improvements  (100, Bradshaw, 2009). This approach not only enhances the quality of software products but also improves the productivity of the development process (48, \u4fee, 2001).\n\nFor smaller organizations, focusing on specific areas such as construction and testing practices can significantly influence process improvement at a relatively low cost  (166, Lima et al., 2017). This targeted approach allows companies with limited resources to achieve substantial benefits from their SPI efforts.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that many companies still face challenges in SPI implementation, despite the longevity of these initiatives  (152, Niazi, 2015). A good understanding of the factors that positively influence SPI implementation is crucial for organizations to identify effective strategies for successful SPI initiatives. Measurement plays a vital role in this context, providing the necessary insights to overcome implementation hurdles and drive organizational success.\n\nIn conclusion, the impact of measurement on organizational success in the context of software engineering process improvements is substantial. By enabling objective evaluation, facilitating informed decision-making, and supporting continuous improvement, measurement strategies contribute significantly to enhanced software quality, increased productivity, and overall business performance.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Key approaches include semantic-based methods, probability vector manipulation, and zero-watermarking, with a growing emphasis on resisting various attacks while maintaining text quality.\n\nRecent years have seen significant advancements in text watermarking techniques, driven by the need to protect digital content and trace the origin of AI-generated text. One notable approach is the use of autoregressive language models to plant watermarks that are robust to perturbations  (61, Thickstun et al., 2023). This method allows for watermark detection by aligning the text to a random number sequence known only to the key holder.\n\nAnother innovative technique is GINSEW, which injects secret signals into the probability vector of decoding steps for each target token  (63, Wang et al., 2023). This method has shown significant improvements in detecting instances of IP infringement while minimizing impact on generation quality.\n\nSemantic-based approaches have also gained traction. Pan et al. proposed a semantic invariant watermarking method that provides both attack robustness and security robustness by determining watermark logits based on the semantics of preceding tokens  (66, Pan et al., 2023).\n\nZero-watermarking techniques have emerged as a non-intrusive method for text protection. These approaches embed watermarks logically without altering the plain text, as demonstrated by the INLPETWA method, which integrates zero text watermarking with hidden Markov models (50, Al-Wesabi et al., 2020).\n\nResearchers are also exploring the use of word frequency and linguistic modifications for watermarking. A text zero-watermarking technique based on word frequency has shown good robustness against attacks such as cutting, pasting, and reversing (5, De-liang, 2009). Similarly, authorship protection through linguistic modifications has been proposed as a way to embed watermarks without changing the text's appearance  (6, M et al., 2009).\n\nThe evolution of text watermarking is closely tied to the development of large language models (LLMs). These models not only enhance watermarking capabilities through improved text understanding and generation but also require watermarking for their own copyright protection  (68, LIU et al., 2023).\n\nAs the field progresses, there is a growing focus on developing watermarking algorithms that can resist various attacks, including paraphrasing, translation, and fine-tuning  (72, Wang et al., 2023)  (73, Zhou et al., 2023). Researchers are also working on certified defense techniques to guarantee watermark unremovability under certain attack conditions.\n\nWhile significant progress has been made, challenges remain. Current watermarking algorithms struggle to simultaneously achieve attack robustness and security robustness  (66, Pan et al., 2023). Additionally, the effectiveness of watermarks can be compromised by paraphrasing and other text modification techniques  (64, Tang et al., 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, recent text watermarking techniques are increasingly sophisticated, focusing on balancing robustness, invisibility, and security. As the field continues to evolve, researchers are working towards developing more resilient watermarking methods that can withstand a variety of attacks while maintaining text quality and detectability.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Watermarking is an effective strategy to detect the LLM-generated content by encoding a pre-defined secret watermark to facilitate the detection process... Such watermark can be easily eliminated by paraphrase and correspondingly the detection effectiveness will be greatly compromised.\n\n\n\nRobustness of Text Watermarking Techniques\nTLDR: Text watermarking techniques face various challenges in maintaining robustness against attacks. While some methods show resilience to specific attacks, paraphrasing and text modification remain significant challenges for many watermarking approaches.\n\nRecent advancements in text watermarking have focused on improving the robustness of these techniques against various attacks. Robustness in text watermarking refers to the ability to detect or extract the watermark after the watermarked text has been subjected to attacks or modifications  (51, Khedr, 2020). These attacks can be broadly categorized into formatting-based attacks (e.g., font changing, printing, retyping, copy & paste, OCR) and tampering-based attacks (e.g., text reordering, insertion, deletion)  (51, Khedr, 2020).\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of certain watermarking techniques against specific types of attacks. For instance, some algorithms have shown robustness against electronic text attacks such as copying and pasting, text formatting, and text tampering for tampering ratios up to 84%  (42, SJARIF et al., 2018). Zero-watermarking approaches have also shown promise in resisting tampering attacks like insertion and deletion  (34, Bhambri et al., 2015).\n\nHowever, paraphrasing attacks remain a significant challenge for many text watermarking techniques. Recent studies have identified inherent difficulties in protecting text watermarks against such attacks  (79, He et al., 2024). While some watermarks have demonstrated effectiveness against discrete alterations and copy-paste attacks, their performance against paraphrasing attacks, especially when embedding long bit strings into short paragraphs, remains unsatisfactory  (79, He et al., 2024).\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of text watermarking techniques, researchers often employ various attack methods. These include using language models like ChatGPT, DIPPER, and BART for paraphrasing attacks, as well as applying emoji attacks and other tricky modifications  (62, Zhao et al., 2023). The replace tokens attack, which combines removing tokens and filling the sentence with noise, has been identified as one of the most severe sentence-level attacks  (67, Munyer et al., 2023).\n\nSome watermarking techniques have shown specific strengths against certain types of attacks. For example, the Exponential and GumbelSoft watermarks have demonstrated particular robustness against the T5-span attack  (85, Yang et al., 2024). Additionally, techniques based on synonymy substitution and majority voting have shown improved robustness against distortions caused by printing, phototypesetting, scanning, faxing, and re-typing  (4, Liu et al., 2009)  (13, Chuan, 2010).\n\nIt's important to note that achieving absolute robustness against all possible attacks and their combinations may be impossible  (40, Varshney, 2017). There is often a trade-off between robustness, watermark data rate, and imperceptibility. While high robustness can be achieved with appropriate design, it typically comes at the cost of other desirable watermarking properties  (40, Varshney, 2017).\n\nIn conclusion, while significant progress has been made in developing robust text watermarking techniques, challenges remain, particularly in defending against sophisticated attacks like paraphrasing. Ongoing research continues to focus on improving the resilience of watermarking methods against a wide range of potential attacks while maintaining the quality and utility of the watermarked text.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(40, Varshney, 2017) | n_citations: 1 | Attacks on Digital Watermarks: Classification, Implications, Benchmarks ]: \nRobustness against attacks is a major watermarking requirement. Absolute robustness against all possible attacks and their combinations may be impossible to achieve... In fact, with appropriate design, fairly high robustness can be achieved, but it should be pointed out that robustness always has to be traded against watermark data rate and imperceptibility\n\n\n\nVulnerabilities and Attacks on Text Watermarks\nTLDR: Text watermarks face various vulnerabilities, particularly against paraphrasing and structural attacks. Common threats include insertion, deletion, reordering, and reformatting, with paraphrasing attacks emerging as a significant challenge for modern watermarking techniques.\n\n- Structural Vulnerabilities: Text watermarks based on structural approaches are often vulnerable to conventional attacks such as insertion, removal, reformatting, and reordering  (41, Ahvanooey et al., 2018). These attacks can significantly compromise the robustness of watermarked documents.\n\n- Format-based Attacks: Watermarking methods that rely on document formats (e.g., DOC, PDF, HTML, XML) are susceptible to attacks targeting unused space and metadata  (33, Zhu et al., 2015). These vulnerabilities can lead to the detection and potential removal of watermark data.\n\n- Paraphrasing Attacks: Modern watermarking techniques face significant challenges from paraphrasing attacks. Researchers have developed novel attack methods, such as the bigram paraphrase attack, which minimizes bigram overlap during paraphrasing to test the robustness of watermarking algorithms  (65, Hou et al., 2023).\n\n- Copy-Paste Attacks: Watermarked text can be compromised by inserting it into corresponding human-generated prompts, potentially making detection difficult  (84, Ashish et al., 2024).\n\n- Random Tampering: Text watermarking solutions often struggle against random tampering attacks, including insertion, deletion, and reordering  (15, John, 2011).\n\n- Text Retyping and Paraphrasing: Traditional text watermarking methods show limited resistance to text retyping and paraphrasing attacks  (10, Jalil et al., 2010).\n\n- Linguistic Transformations: Additional attacks on watermarked text include synonym substitution and syntactic transformation attacks, which can alter the text while potentially preserving its meaning  (70, Ng et al., 2023).\n\n- Detectability Issues: Some watermarking approaches, particularly those based on content or format manipulation, are vulnerable to detection of the watermark data in the cover text, exposing them to potential security attacks  (29, Alginahi et al., 2014).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These datasets are crucial for benchmarking SLAM algorithms across different applications, from autonomous driving to indoor navigation.\n\nThe characteristics and applications of SLAM datasets are diverse, reflecting the varied challenges in different SLAM scenarios:\n\n1. Sensor configurations: Datasets cater to various sensor setups, including monocular, stereo, RGB-D, and visual-inertial systems. For instance, the EuRoC MAV dataset is specifically designed for visual-inertial odometry and SLAM evaluation  (73, Rao et al., 2023) (40, Antigny et al., 2021).\n\n2. Environmental diversity: Datasets cover a range of environments, from indoor spaces to urban settings and natural landscapes. The KITTI dataset, for example, is widely used for autonomous driving scenarios  (38, Hadachi et al., 2020), while the TUM RGB-D dataset is popular for indoor SLAM evaluation  (19, Judd et al., 2019).\n\n3. Ground truth availability: Many datasets provide ground truth information for accurate performance evaluation. The MIT Stata and NCLT datasets offer ground truth robot positions estimated using SLAM algorithms  (15, Jeong et al., 2019).\n\n4. Application-specific datasets: Some datasets are tailored for specific applications or research focus areas. For instance, the EuRoC dataset is commonly used for testing visual SLAM systems in aerial vehicle contexts  (22, Bonardi et al., 2019).\n\n5. Benchmark capabilities: Datasets like KITTI have become standard benchmarks for comparing various SLAM methods. It has been used to evaluate numerous algorithms, including ORB-SLAM, DSO, and Stereo LSD-VO  (51, Sevil et al., 2021).\n\n6. Extensibility and versatility: Some datasets, like those supported by SLAMBench2, allow for evaluating a wide variety of SLAM algorithms across multiple datasets  (11, Nardi et al., 2018).\n\n7. Comparative analysis: Researchers often use multiple datasets to provide a comprehensive evaluation of their SLAM systems. For example, studies have used combinations like EuRoC and OpenLORIS to compare visual SLAM systems  (73, Rao et al., 2023).\n\n8. Sensor fusion evaluation: Datasets like KITTI and EuRoC allow for testing SLAM systems that integrate multiple sensor types, such as cameras and inertial measurement units  (74, Khole et al., 2023).\n\nThe choice of dataset depends on the specific SLAM application and research objectives. Researchers often use a combination of datasets to ensure robust evaluation across different scenarios and sensor configurations [7 | 83459364 | Labb\u00e9 et al. | 2018 | Citations: 593].

Efficient counting algorithms exist for specific types and sizes of subgraphs, with performance varying based on graph properties and subgraph complexity.\n\n- Cliques: Counting k-cliques is a fundamental problem in graph theory. Algorithms exist for counting cliques of various sizes, including 3-cliques (triangles), 4-cliques, and larger k-cliques  (79, Dumitrescu et al., 2023). For graphs with bounded degeneracy, clique counting can be done in linear time  (86, Seshadhri et al., 2023).\n\n- Cycles: Algorithms have been developed for counting cycles of different lengths. For example, 4-cycles (also known as K2,2 subgraphs) can be counted in O(n\u03c9) or O(m1.48) time  (60, Shimizu et al., 2020). Efficient algorithms exist for counting cycles of length up to 11 in O~(m3) time  (80, Komarath et al., 2023).\n\n- Paths: Counting k-vertex paths is another important subgraph problem. Algorithms have been developed for counting paths of length up to 10 in O~(m2) time  (80, Komarath et al., 2023). For general k-vertex paths, there are algorithms with running times dependent on the maximum degree of the graph  (2, Lee et al., 2018).\n\n- Induced subgraphs: Algorithms exist for finding and counting induced subgraphs of specific sizes. For instance, in intersection graphs of axis-aligned boxes, any k-vertex induced subgraph can be found in O(n0.429k+O(1)) time for constant k  (78, Chan, 2022).\n\n- Graphlets: These are small, connected, non-isomorphic subgraphs that provide insights into network structure. Graphlet counting algorithms typically focus on subgraphs of size 5 or less due to computational complexity  (49, Pashanasangi et al., 2019). Triangles, as 3-node graphlets, have received particular attention due to their relative simplicity and importance in network analysis  (65, Thomo et al., 2020).\n\n- General k-node subgraphs: For arbitrary connected k-node subgraphs, algorithms have been developed that improve upon the \"meet-in-the-middle\" approach, achieving running times of n0.45470382k+O(1) for certain cases (1, Bj\u00f6rklund et al., 2013).\n\nIt's worth noting that as k increases, the computational complexity of counting k-node subgraphs grows rapidly, making the problem intractable for larger values of k in practice  (26, Jain et al., 2016). This has led to the development of approximation algorithms and specialized techniques for specific types of subgraphs or graph properties  (13, Charikar et al., 2010).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Recent advancements have improved upon traditional brute-force approaches, with specialized algorithms for specific subgraphs and graph characteristics.\n\nCounting k-node subgraphs is a computationally intensive task, with complexities often dependent on the size and structure of both the input graph and the subgraph being counted. Traditional brute-force approaches for counting k-vertex subgraphs have a time complexity of O(nk)  (76, Dumitrescu, 2021), which becomes impractical for larger graphs or subgraphs.\n\nSignificant improvements have been made for specific subgraph types:\n\n1. Cliques: For k-cliques, algorithms with time complexity O(mk\u0394) exist, where m is the number of edges and \u0394 is the maximum degree  (55, Shun et al., 2020). In graphs with bounded degeneracy d, k-cliques can be counted in O(dk-2m) time  (41, Seshadhri et al., 2018).\n\n2. Cycles: 4-cycles (K2,2) can be counted in O(n\u03c9) or O(m1.48) time, where \u03c9 is the matrix multiplication exponent  (60, Shimizu et al., 2020). Recent work has produced O~(m3)-time algorithms for counting cycles of length up to 11  (80, Komarath et al., 2023).\n\n3. Paths: Algorithms exist for counting k-vertex paths in O((2\u0394-2)\u230ak/2\u230b n k2 log n) time  (2, Lee et al., 2018). For paths up to length 10, O~(m2)-time algorithms have been developed  (80, Komarath et al., 2023).\n\n4. General subgraphs: For arbitrary k-vertex subgraphs, recent advancements have improved upon the \"meet-in-the-middle\" approach, achieving running times of n0.45470382k+O(1) for certain cases (1, Bj\u00f6rklund et al., 2013). Another notable result shows that copies of any single k-vertex subgraph type can be counted in O(n0.174k+o(k)) time  (87, Lincoln et al., 2023).\n\n5. Induced subgraphs: In intersection graphs of axis-aligned boxes, k-vertex induced subgraphs can be found in O(n0.429k+O(1)) time for constant k  (78, Chan, 2022).\n\n6. Graphlets: The naive algorithm for counting all graphlets of size k takes O(k2nk) time  (35, Kumar et al., 2018). However, more efficient algorithms exist for specific graphlet sizes and types.\n\nSeveral factors can affect the efficiency of counting algorithms:\n\n- Graph properties: Algorithms leveraging graph properties like degeneracy or maximum degree can achieve better performance for certain subgraph types  (41, Seshadhri et al., 2018)  (2, Lee et al., 2018).\n\n- Approximation: For larger subgraphs or graphs, approximation algorithms can provide faster results with provable error bounds  (26, Jain et al., 2016).\n\n- Parallelization: Some algorithms have been adapted for parallel or distributed computing environments, improving practical performance  (70, Lu et al., 2020).\n\n- Graph representation: Specialized data structures or graph representations can lead to more efficient counting algorithms for certain subgraph types  (66, Rooij, 2020).\n\nIt's important to note that as k increases, the computational complexity grows rapidly, making exact counting intractable for larger subgraphs in practice  (21, Ahmed et al., 2015). This has led to ongoing research in approximation algorithms and specialized techniques for specific subgraph types or graph properties  (50, Seshadhri et al., 2019).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These properties allow for specialized algorithms that can achieve better time complexities compared to general approaches.\n\nSeveral graph properties have been identified as crucial factors in improving the efficiency of subgraph counting algorithms:\n\n1. Degeneracy: Graphs with low degeneracy allow for more efficient subgraph counting. For O(1)-degenerate graphs, such as those excluding a fixed minor, all cliques can be listed in O(n) time  (16, Kawarabayashi et al., 2011). More generally, in graphs with degeneracy d, k-cliques can be counted in O(k^2 d^(k-1) n) time  (36, Bressan, 2018). For graphs with degeneracy d = O(polylog(n)), induced copies of any k-vertex subgraph can be counted in time f(k) \u00b7 \u00d5(n^(\u230ak/4\u230b + 2)), which is significantly faster than general algorithms  (37, Bressan, 2018).\n\n2. Arboricity: Graphs with bounded arboricity form a rich family that includes planar graphs, bounded treewidth graphs, and bounded degree graphs  (57, Ron et al., 2020). For graphs with arboricity at most \u03b1, k-cliques can be counted in O(n + m\u03b1^(k-2)) time  (41, Seshadhri et al., 2018). This property allows for efficient subgraph counting in many practical scenarios.\n\n3. DAG-treewidth: For directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), a novel tree-like decomposition called DAG-treewidth \u03c4(H) has been introduced. If a subgraph H has DAG-treewidth \u03c4(H) and the host graph G has degeneracy d, induced copies of H in G can be counted in time f(d,k) \u00b7 \u00d5(n^\u03c4(H))  (37, Bressan, 2018).\n\n4. Specific structural properties: Certain graph classes allow for highly efficient subgraph counting. For instance, in intersection graphs of axis-aligned boxes, algorithms for finding k-vertex induced subgraphs can achieve O(n^(0.429k+O(1))) time complexity for constant k [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n5. Geometric properties: In geometric graphs, such as Delaunay triangulations or transmission graphs of point sets, specialized algorithms can be developed. For example, detecting triangles and computing the girth in these graphs can be done in O(n log n) expected time  (52, Mulzer et al., 2019).\n\nRecent research has focused on developing algorithms that leverage these graph properties to achieve better time complexities. For instance, new upper bounds have been established for subgraph counting in degenerate graphs  (71, Bressan et al., 2021). Additionally, algorithms with O(m^(2/3)) update time have been developed for counting all non-induced subgraphs in dynamic graphs  (72, Henzinger et al., 2021).\n\nUnderstanding and exploiting these graph properties can lead to significant improvements in subgraph counting efficiency, often beating general-purpose algorithms by large factors. This is particularly important for practical applications dealing with large-scale networks that exhibit specific structural characteristics.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods enable the identification of structural motifs, protein-protein interactions, and potential drug targets.\n\nGraph theory and subgraph analysis techniques have become indispensable tools in bioinformatics and molecular biology, offering powerful methods for analyzing complex biological structures and interactions. One of the primary applications is in protein structure analysis, where subgraph isomorphism and maximum common subgraph algorithms are used to identify structural relationships between biological macromolecules  (2, Willett et al., 0). These techniques are particularly valuable for comparing proteins with known three-dimensional structures obtained through crystallography or NMR spectroscopy.\n\nLocal structure patterns in proteins have gained significant attention for their role in predicting protein function and interactions. Researchers have demonstrated the value of these patterns in applications such as predicting protein-protein interactions, protein engineering, and drug design  (15, Wang et al., 2006). By identifying recurring subgraphs or motifs within protein structures, scientists can gain insights into functional similarities and potential binding sites  (22, Buhr et al., 2009).\n\nIn the field of proteomics, graph-based approaches have been developed for protein identification and characterization. These methods include homology modeling based on clique finding, identification of side-chain clusters using graph spectrum analysis, and de novo peptide sequencing using spectrum graph models  (29, Yan et al., 2011). Such techniques provide researchers with a diverse toolkit for analyzing protein structures and functions.\n\nSubgraph counting has emerged as a critical graph analytic in bioinformatics, particularly for detecting and characterizing local structures (motifs) in protein interaction networks  (36, Madduri et al., 2013). This approach allows researchers to identify recurring patterns of interactions that may indicate functional modules or conserved biological processes.\n\nThe discovery of protein complexes is another important application of graph algorithms in bioinformatics. By analyzing protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, researchers can identify highly connected subgraphs that represent potential protein complexes  (20, Schneider et al., 2009). Advanced methods have been developed to analyze both weighted and unweighted PPI networks for organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Homo sapiens (human), improving our understanding of biological processes and protein functions  (69, Hernandez et al., 2017).\n\nFurthermore, subgraph mining techniques have been applied to identify proteins with similar molecular functions based on common structural features. This approach has been particularly useful in cases where sequence similarity alone is insufficient to infer functional relationships  (26, Iakoucheva et al., 2010). Additionally, these methods have been combined with small molecule docking strategies to identify potential catalytic sites and predict enzyme functions.\n\nThe continued development and application of graph theory and subgraph analysis techniques in bioinformatics and molecular biology demonstrate their ongoing importance in advancing our understanding of complex biological systems and in supporting drug discovery efforts.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods have shown significant improvements in identifying fraudulent activities in social networks, financial transactions, and online platforms.\n\n- Dense subgraph detection in bipartite graphs has been used to identify fake reviews and followers in social media platforms. The FRAUDAR algorithm successfully detected a subgraph of over 4000 suspicious accounts in a Twitter follower-followee graph with 1.47 billion edges, demonstrating its effectiveness in spotting fraudsters even when they use camouflage or hijacked accounts  (55, Song et al., 2016).\n\n- Anomaly detection in tensor data, which can represent complex multi-dimensional relationships, has been applied to various domains including social media, Wikipedia, and network traffic analysis. The DENSESALERT algorithm has shown success in identifying anomalous patterns in real-world tensors, particularly those that might be missed by other methods  (66, Faloutsos et al., 2017).\n\n- In financial crime detection, graph-based methods have significantly improved the ability to detect money laundering transactions. Recent research has shown up to a 30% improvement in the minority-class F1 score compared to standard message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Similar improvements were observed in phishing detection, with F1 score increases of around 15%  (148, Wattenhofer et al., 2023).\n\n- The concept of finding subgraphs with maximum average degree has been applied to fraud detection in social and review networks. Both exact and approximate algorithms have been developed for this purpose, allowing for efficient identification of suspicious dense subgraphs  (77, Shin et al., 2018).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These techniques enable researchers to uncover important network properties, detect communities, and analyze user behavior patterns.\n\nSubgraph analysis has become an essential tool in social network analysis, offering valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of online social networks (OSNs). One of the most significant applications in this domain is the exploration of network motifs, which are locally connected subgraph patterns. These motifs help researchers better understand the underlying structure and function of social networks  (35, Ribeiro et al., 2013). By developing efficient sampling methods to estimate subgraph statistics, researchers can analyze large-scale networks with fewer computational resources, making it possible to study massive OSNs effectively.\n\nClique counting is another critical technique in social network analysis, revealing important properties about the structure of massive graphs, especially in social networks  (57, Jain et al., 2016) (64, Eden et al., 2017). Cliques, which are fully connected subgraphs, can indicate tightly-knit communities or groups of users with strong connections. The ability to count cliques efficiently has become an integral part of recent dense subgraph discovery algorithms, enabling researchers to identify cohesive groups within large social networks.\n\nThese subgraph counting techniques have numerous applications in social network analysis, including community detection, user behavior analysis, and influence propagation studies  (39, Antonio et al., 2013). By identifying recurring patterns and structures within social networks, researchers can gain insights into how information spreads, how communities form and evolve, and how users interact with one another.\n\nAn interesting application of subgraph analysis in social networks extends to the study of creativity and brain networks. Research has shown that highly creative individuals' brains present significantly more short cycles in their neural networks  (68, Priebe et al., 2017). This finding demonstrates the potential for subgraph analysis techniques to bridge the gap between social network analysis and cognitive science, offering new perspectives on how network structures might relate to human behavior and cognition.\n\nAs social networks continue to grow in size and complexity, the development of efficient subgraph counting and analysis techniques remains crucial for understanding these vast interconnected systems. These methods not only provide valuable insights into the structure and function of social networks but also have the potential to inform the design of more effective social platforms and targeted marketing strategies [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1.

This process involves frequent subgraph mining in sets of molecular graphs, which is computationally demanding but crucial for analyzing large numbers of drug candidates  (8, Nijssen et al., 2004)  (12, Berthold et al., 2006).\n\n- Discriminative molecular fragment selection, formulated as a frequent subgraph mining problem, is used to identify structural features that distinguish between different classes of molecules.

This theory emphasizes how cognitive processes are distributed across individuals, artifacts, and environments, informing system design to support collaborative and efficient interactions.\n\nDistributed cognition has emerged as a significant theoretical foundation in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), offering a novel perspective on how humans interact with technology and each other. Hollan et al. describe distributed cognition as a \"radical reorientation\" in thinking about HCI design, specifically tailored to understanding interactions among people and technologies  (7, Hollan et al., 2000). This approach diverges from traditional cognitive science by extending the boundaries of cognition beyond the individual mind to encompass the entire socio-technical system.\n\nThe theory posits that cognitive processes are distributed across individuals, artifacts, and environments, rather than being confined to individual minds. Hutchins et al. position distributed cognition as an alternative to information processing psychology, providing a more comprehensive foundation for HCI  (8, Hutchins et al., 2003). This perspective allows designers and researchers to consider how cognitive tasks are shared between humans and technological artifacts, leading to more effective and intuitive interfaces.\n\nOne of the key strengths of distributed cognition in HCI is its practical applicability to system design. Rogers et al. highlight that the applied aim of distributed cognition is to contribute directly to system design and implementation  (2, Rogers et al., 1994). This focus on practical application makes the theory particularly valuable for HCI practitioners seeking to create more effective and user-friendly systems.\n\nRecent research continues to explore the implications of distributed cognition for interface design. Usmani et al. emphasize how this theoretical framework can inform the design of interfaces that offload cognitive burden and promote more collaborative and efficient interactions  (49, Usmani et al., 2023). By recognizing the distributed nature of cognitive processes, designers can create systems that better support users in their tasks, leveraging the cognitive resources available in the environment and among collaborators.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This approach informs the creation of interfaces and environments that support distributed cognitive processes, focusing on externalization of resources and awareness of cognitive artifacts.\n\nThe application of distributed cognition theory to system design has led to innovative approaches in creating collaborative and interactive technologies. Haraty et al. demonstrated this by employing distributed cognition theory to design AnalyticStream, a collaborative visual analytics system that facilitates the reuse of analysis outcomes  (23, Haraty et al., 2012). Their work highlights how viewing the design space through the lens of distributed cognition can transform design problems by bringing them into the cognition domain, enabling the application of other human cognition theories to solve complex design challenges.\n\nIn remote collaboration scenarios, distributed cognition principles have been particularly valuable. Wang et al. presented a computer-mediated remote collaborative design system that enhances distributed cognition by combining telepresence technology with Virtualized Reality  (20, Wang et al., 2009). This system affords a high level of externalization of shared resources, supporting mutual awareness and distributed cognition in remote design teams.\n\nThe design of information technology to support distributed cognition can be guided by specific principles. Linden notes six such principles: ownership, easy travel, multiplicity, indeterminacy, emergence, and mixed forms cognition  (13, Linden, 2006). These principles provide a framework for designers to create systems that effectively support distributed cognitive processes across users and artifacts.\n\nResearchers can use distributed cognition analysis to inform system design. Ioannou et al. suggest that through the findings of a distributed cognition analysis, researchers can identify prominent aspects in the current design of a system or environment to create effective human-computer interactions  (39, Ioannou et al., 2019). This approach ensures that the design of interactive systems aligns with how cognition is distributed in real-world contexts.\n\nThe application of distributed cognition in system design also draws inspiration from related fields. Pederson notes that the design approach finds inspiration in technology-driven areas such as Ubiquitous/Pervasive Computing and Graspable/Tangible User Interfaces, as well as empirical and theoretical research on Distributed Cognition  (10, Pederson, 2003). This interdisciplinary approach enriches the design process, leading to more comprehensive and effective systems that support distributed cognitive processes.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Distributed Cognition\n\n\n\nDistributed Cognition in Social Computing and Web Technologies\nTLDR: Distributed cognition theory has significantly influenced the development of social computing and web technologies, shaping our understanding of collective intelligence and online collaboration. This approach has led to new conceptualizations of social machines, distributed mentoring, and the cognitive integration of web technologies.\n\nThe application of distributed cognition theory to social computing and web technologies has opened up new avenues for understanding and designing collaborative online systems. Clowes et al. highlight that the Social Web has become a major focus for those interested in collective intelligence and distributed cognition, introducing concepts such as social computing, human computation, and technology-mediated social participation  (35, Clowes et al., 2017). These concepts reflect the growing recognition of the web as a platform for distributed cognitive processes.\n\nThe idea of social machines, which are socio-technical systems that enable cognitive processing across human agents and technological artifacts, has emerged as a key concept in this field. Multiple researchers have explored this concept, with Palermos suggesting that social machines should be viewed as distributed cognitive systems  (33, Palermos, 2016)  (38, Smart, 2018)  (43, Smart et al., 2021)  (42, Cox et al., 2020). Wikis, in particular, have been identified as suitable platforms for building social machines due to their ability to facilitate the mutual interactions necessary for distributed cognitive systems  (33, Palermos, 2016).\n\nThe influence of distributed cognition on social computing extends to online mentoring practices. Campbell et al. introduced the concept of \"distributed mentoring,\" which builds upon Hutchins' distributed cognition theory by focusing on how networked technologies' affordances shape mentoring processes in online communities  (32, Campbell et al., 2015). This extension of distributed cognition theory to specific social practices demonstrates its versatility in explaining online collaborative behaviors.\n\nThe impact of social tagging systems on knowledge acquisition and adaptation has also been explored through the lens of distributed cognition. Fu presented a rational model developed within this framework to explain how social tags influence cognitive activities in ill-defined information tasks  (15, Fu, 2008). This research highlights the potential of collaborative systems to shape higher-level cognitive processes, demonstrating the practical applications of distributed cognition theory in social computing design.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all interactions with web technologies necessarily constitute cognitive integration. Halpin examines the conditions under which the Web can be considered an extension of one's mind, pointing out that in many cases, external media like the Web simply serve as tools for coordinating problem-solving through distributed cognition rather than being fully integrated into cognitive processes  (27, Halpin, 2013).\n\nIn its broader sense, social computing encompasses any computational systems that support social behavior  (28, Maarry et al., 2013). This wide-ranging definition allows for the application of distributed cognition principles across various online platforms and technologies, informing the design of features that facilitate collective intelligence and collaborative problem-solving.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(35, Clowes et al., 2017) | n_citations: 73 | The Cognitive Ecology of the Internet ]: \nThe Social Web is currently a major focus of interest for those concerned with issues of collective intelligence and distributed cognition... The conceptual landscape of the Social Web is thus littered with terms like social computing... human computation... collective intelligence... social machines... technology-mediated social participation\n\n2. [(33, Palermos, 2016) | n_citations: 18 | Social machines: a philosophical engineering ]: \nWikis therefore are a fitting platform for building Social Machines, because they can provide the means to instantiate the mutual interactions that are necessary for the emergence of distributed cognitive systems.\n\n3. [(38, Smart, 2018) | n_citations: 8 | Knowledge machines ]: \nPalermos (2017) for example, countenances a cognitive systems view of social machines, which casts social machines as distributed cognitive systems-that is, as sociotechnical systems that perform cognitive tasks.\n\n4.

We iterate the conditions upon which cognitive extension and integration can be upheld, and inspect these in light of the Web... there are many cases where external media like the Web are not actually cognitively integrated, but simply serve as a way to co-ordinate intelligent problem-solving via distributed cognition.\n\n9. [(28, Maarry et al., 2013) | n_citations: 0 | Intelligent Information Processing - Chances of Crowdsourcing (NII Shonan Meeting 2013-15) ]: \nIn the weaker sense of the term, social computing has to do with supporting any sort of social behavior in or through computational systems.\n\n\n\nSpecific Design Principles and Features Informed by Distributed Cognition\nTLDR: Distributed cognition theory has informed specific design principles for social computing systems, emphasizing user-friendly interfaces, personalized content, and features that promote positive emotions. These principles also consider socio-technical affordances and the mutual influence between online conversational practices and interface design.\n\n\u2022 User-friendly interfaces: Social media platforms should prioritize intuitive and easy-to-use interfaces that align with users' cognitive processes. This design principle supports distributed cognition by reducing cognitive load and facilitating smoother interactions within the socio-technical system  (48, Tang, 2023).\n\n\u2022 Personalized content: Systems should incorporate features that tailor content to individual users, recognizing the distributed nature of cognition across users and technology. This personalization can enhance user satisfaction and engagement with the platform  (48, Tang, 2023).\n\n\u2022 Emotion-promoting features: Design elements that evoke positive emotions can contribute to a more satisfying user experience. This principle acknowledges the role of affect in distributed cognitive processes within social computing environments  (48, Tang, 2023).\n\n\u2022 Socio-technical affordances: Designers should consider the interplay between social, cultural, and cognitive elements when developing features. This approach recognizes that technology adoption patterns are influenced by more than just structural or functional aspects  (25, Fragoso et al., 2012).\n\n\u2022 Support for online conversational practices: Interface affordances should be designed with an understanding of their mutual influence on online conversation patterns. This principle highlights the importance of aligning system features with the distributed cognitive processes involved in online social interactions  (25, Fragoso et al., 2012).\n\n\u2022 Cognitive insights integration: The design and development of social media services should incorporate understanding of cognitive mechanisms. This principle ensures that the system supports and enhances distributed cognitive processes among users  (48, Tang, 2023).\n\n[LLM MEMORY | 2024] While not explicitly stated in the provided references, it's worth noting that these design principles often work in concert to create a cohesive user experience that supports distributed cognition. For example, a user-friendly interface combined with personalized content can significantly reduce cognitive load, allowing users to engage more effectively with the distributed cognitive system represented by the social computing platform and its user base.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(48, Tang, 2023) | n_citations: 1 | Conducting in-Depth Research on Influencing Mechanisms for Improving Social Media Services Using Cognition Theory ]: \nStudy results point to the importance of understanding cognitive mechanisms in the design and development of social media services by alienating cognitive insights... Based on the study findings, it is suggested that social media platforms should focus on providing user-friendly interfaces, personalized content, and features that promote positive emotions to enhance user satisfaction and usage.\n\n2. [(25, Fragoso et al., 2012) | n_citations: 5 | Interface affordances and social practices in online communication systems ]: \nThe underlying premise is that social, cultural and cognitive elements are as important as structural, functional and aesthetic features in the development of technology adoption patterns... The results led to the proposal of a categorization of socio-technical affordances and confirmed the mutual influence between online conversational practices and interface affordances.\n\n\n\n"}

Designers are grappling with how to effectively conceptualize and work with AI's inherent uncertainty and complexity.\n\nThe concept of AI as a design material has gained traction in recent years, prompting designers to reconsider their approach to incorporating AI into their work. Coulton et al. argue that while we often don't perceive technology, particularly digital algorithms within AI, as something we can easily manipulate, it should be considered a material for design  (2, Coulton et al., 2020). This perspective encourages designers to explore AI's properties, understanding its capabilities and limitations as a prerequisite to generative design thinking  (70, Seifert et al., 2021).\n\nHowever, conceptualizing AI as a design material presents unique challenges. Unlike traditional materials, AI resists straightforward manipulation and understanding  (70, Seifert et al., 2021). The complexity of developing AI models and choosing between different options can hinder designers' ability to apply their usual deterministic \"material\" perspective  (114, Vaughan et al., 2023). This struggle to understand AI can impede design ideation, making it difficult for designers to recognize obvious applications, envision novel uses, or avoid attempting technically infeasible implementations  (114, Vaughan et al., 2023).\n\nDespite these challenges, some researchers propose embracing AI's inherent uncertainty as a creative resource. Odom et al. suggest that rather than viewing the unpredictability of AI as problematic, designers should consider these qualities as contingencies of working with AI and potential generative resources for design  (134, Odom et al., 2023). This shift in perspective aligns with emerging approaches like the \"More-than Human-Centered design\" proposed by Coulton et al., which presents AI and data as materials for design, encouraging a broader conceptualization of AI's role in the design process  (87, Coulton et al., 2021).\n\nAs the field continues to evolve, designers are adapting their conceptualization of AI as a design material, balancing its unique properties with traditional design approaches to unlock new creative possibilities.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The inherent uncertainty and complexity of AI systems further complicate the design process, requiring new approaches to leverage AI's unique properties effectively.\n\nIntegrating AI as a design material presents numerous challenges for designers, stemming from its complex and often unpredictable nature. One of the primary obstacles is the lack of clear understanding of AI's capabilities  (72, Sow et al., 2021). This knowledge gap can significantly hinder the design ideation process, causing designers to overlook obvious applications of AI or struggle to envision innovative uses  (114, Vaughan et al., 2023).\n\nThe complexity of AI systems also poses difficulties in prototyping and implementation. Designers often find it challenging to choose between different AI models and develop prototypes that accurately represent AI functionalities  (72, Sow et al., 2021). This complexity can lead to attempts at technically infeasible implementations, further complicating the design process  (114, Vaughan et al., 2023).\n\nMoreover, the inherent uncertainty in AI outputs adds another layer of complexity to the design process. Designers tend to focus on situations where there is both great uncertainty around a capability and significant complexity in the AI system's output  (117, Turri et al., 2023). This focus can make it challenging to integrate AI into traditional design approaches that rely on more deterministic outcomes.\n\nThe emergence of generative AI introduces additional challenges for human-centered design. The serendipitous and uncertain nature of the design space created by generative AI requires designers to adapt their methodologies, especially in use cases where users work directly with AI systems  (121, Maher et al., 2023).\n\nHowever, some researchers propose a shift in perspective regarding these challenges. Rather than viewing the uncertainty and unpredictability of AI as problematic, they suggest treating these qualities as inherent contingencies of working with AI and potential creative resources for design  (134, Odom et al., 2023). This approach encourages designers to embrace AI's unique properties and explore new ways of incorporating them into the design process.\n\nAs designers continue to grapple with these challenges, the field is evolving to develop new methodologies and approaches that can better accommodate AI as a design material. This ongoing adaptation is crucial for unlocking the full potential of AI in design while navigating its inherent complexities.\n\nReferences:\n1.

It has the potential to transform various design fields, including architecture, visual communication, and industrial design.\n\n- AI can augment designers' creativity by generating aesthetic and creative visual content, potentially improving user experience in various applications, including enterprise software  (3, Tung et al., 2022)  (69, Sun et al., 2021).\n\n- Generative AI technologies enable more rapid and parallel prototyping, potentially elevating design outcomes beyond what was previously limited by human capacity  (170, Zhang et al., 2024).\n\n- AI can assist in automating creative design synthesis, allowing for exploration of design spaces in novel ways  (74, Nobari et al., 2021).\n\n- In the field of architecture, AI has transformed design approaches, influencing areas such as performance assessment, structural optimization, and design decisions  (147, Albaghajati et al., 2023).\n\n- AI technologies like intelligent robots, intelligent interaction, and virtual reality are being used to realize art design creation, potentially revolutionizing the field  (106, Zhao, 2022).\n\n- Design intelligence, a branch of AI, focuses on intelligent models and algorithms in creativity and design, addressing problems in the design process and generating creative solutions  (52, Zhou et al., 2020).\n\n- AI can contribute to the construction of explanatory models of the design act, potentially leading to more knowledgeable computer aids for design  (16, DASGUPTA, 1994)  (27, Novak et al., 2009).\n\n- In industrial design, AI-managed design processes can provide solutions and improvements in efficiency, performance, material selection, and cost optimization  (107, Cianfanelli et al., 2022).\n\n- AI can extend design cognition by acting as an agent in the design thinking process, potentially transforming traditional design approaches  (160, Hui et al., 2023).\n\n- Generative models, particularly GANs, show promise in design automation, potentially improving designers' performance through co-creation with AI  (163, Ghasemi et al., 2023).\n\n- AI technologies can simulate human thinking processes in conceptual design for industrial applications, potentially leading to more creative designs  (92, Kong, 2021).\n\n- Large language models like GPT, with domain-specific fine-tuning, can engage in designerly thinking to generate original and useful design concepts  (151, Luo, 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1.

This transformation presents both challenges and opportunities, pushing designers to rethink their role and approach in an AI-augmented design landscape.\n\nThe integration of AI into design processes is fundamentally altering how designers work, what they create, and why they design  (142, Funk et al., 2023). This shift is not merely about adopting new tools; it's about reimagining the entire design workflow. As AI technologies become increasingly central to human-computer interactions and user experiences, designers find themselves in a unique position to drive stakeholder-centered adaptation of AI technology  (133, Flechtner et al., 2023).\n\nOne of the primary impacts of AI on design processes is the need for designers to develop new skills and practices. The unique challenges posed by AI and machine learning have necessitated the creation of new design practices tailored to these technologies  (80, Nakao et al., 2021). In response, researchers have developed resources, guidelines, and design patterns to provide best practices for addressing AI's design challenges (115, Vi\u00e9gas et al., 2023). These resources aim to help designers navigate the complexities of AI integration and leverage its potential effectively.\n\nA key aspect of this adaptation is the emphasis on experiential learning and hands-on engagement with AI technologies. Enabling designers to \"play with\" AI in support of design ideation has been identified as crucial for gaining a felt sense of AI's capabilities  (101, Falk et al., 2022). This approach aligns with the observation that it is through sketching and prototyping that designers come to understand what AI technology is and can do  (78, JIN et al., 2021). Such experiential learning helps designers develop a more intuitive grasp of AI's potential and limitations, informing their design decisions and approaches.\n\nHowever, the integration of AI into design processes also presents significant challenges. Designers are facing a lack of examples showcasing novel and interesting applications that combine AI and design effectively  (142, Funk et al., 2023). This shortage of exemplars can hinder innovation and make it difficult for designers to envision new possibilities. Additionally, the complexity and often unpredictable nature of AI systems require designers to adapt their processes to address these new challenges  (133, Flechtner et al., 2023).\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, it's clear that design processes must adapt in tandem. This ongoing transformation is pushing designers to reconsider their role, expand their skillsets, and develop new methodologies that can effectively harness the power of AI while addressing its unique challenges. The future of design processes will likely involve a closer collaboration between human designers and AI systems, requiring a delicate balance of human creativity and machine capabilities.\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "95a152ddae491933ef75c797f3584b08", "answer_text": "Definition and Scope\nTLDR: Participatory design and co-design are closely related but distinct approaches. The key difference lies in the level of user empowerment and the specific role of end-users in the design process.\n\nParticipatory design and co-design are both collaborative approaches to design that involve end-users, but they differ in their scope and emphasis. Participatory design is characterized by a strong focus on user empowerment, aiming to give users a significant voice in the design process  (3, Spijkerman et al., 2016). In contrast, co-design is defined as a more cooperative approach where end-users actively contribute to designing a product, potentially offering a higher degree of participation than traditional participatory design methods  (5, Simm et al., 2019).\n\nThe key distinction between these approaches lies in the specific role assigned to end-users and the weight placed on user empowerment. While participatory design emphasizes empowering users throughout the design process, co-design focuses more on the collaborative act of designing together, without necessarily prioritizing empowerment to the same extent  (3, Spijkerman et al., 2016). This subtle difference in emphasis can lead to variations in how users are involved and the overall outcomes of the design process.\n\nIt's important to note that the boundaries between these approaches can sometimes blur, and interpretations may vary among practitioners and researchers [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. However, understanding these nuanced differences can help designers and organizations choose the most appropriate approach for their specific project goals and user engagement strategies.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(3, Spijkerman et al., 2016) | n_citations: 13 | Personalization in Game Design for Healthcare: a Literature Review on its Definitions and Effects ]: \nCo-design thus has a specific role that end-users can have within participatory design... However, according to our definition, participatory design and codesign differ from each other, since co-design puts less weight on the emphasis of user empowerment, as is the case in participatory design\n\n2. [(5, Simm et al., 2019) | n_citations: 4 | Community-University Research: A Warts and All Account ]: \nCo-design... implies that end-users do not merely \"participate\" but co-operatively design a product; hence, some would argue that codesign is inherently more participatory than participatory design\n\n\n\nUser Involvement and Empowerment\nTLDR: Participatory design and co-design differ in their approach to user involvement and empowerment. While participatory design emphasizes user empowerment throughout the process, co-design focuses more on active collaboration without necessarily prioritizing empowerment to the same degree.\n\nBoth participatory design and co-design involve users in the design process, but they differ in the nature and extent of user involvement. Participatory design places a strong emphasis on user empowerment, aiming to give users a significant voice throughout the entire design process  (3, Spijkerman et al., 2016). This approach is distinguished by its focus on actively involving users, which sets it apart from other related methodologies such as User-Centered Design [4 | 158873853 | DELL'ERA et al. | 2019 | Citations: 13].\n\nIn contrast, while co-design also involves users actively, it puts less weight on user empowerment compared to participatory design  (3, Spijkerman et al., 2016). Co-design aims for a continuous and fully shared process where the roles of users and designers are closely intertwined  (7, Antonini, 2021). This approach focuses more on the collaborative act of designing together, with users contributing directly to the product design.\n\nIt's important to note that both approaches offer more extensive user involvement compared to traditional user-centered design. In user-centered design, user involvement may be limited to certain stages of the process and is not always direct  (7, Antonini, 2021). Participatory design and co-design, on the other hand, strive for more consistent and direct user engagement throughout the design process, albeit with different emphases on empowerment.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(3, Spijkerman et al., 2016) | n_citations: 13 | Personalization in Game Design for Healthcare: a Literature Review on its Definitions and Effects ]: \nCo-design thus has a specific role that end-users can have within participatory design... However, according to our definition, participatory design and codesign differ from each other, since co-design puts less weight on the emphasis of user empowerment, as is the case in participatory design\n\n2. [(7, Antonini, 2021) | n_citations: 6 | An Overview of Co-Design: Advantages, Challenges and Perspectives of Users\u2019 Involvement in the Design Process ]: \nMore in detail, both user-centered and co-design approaches put the user at the core of the design process, however, the main difference is how users are involved; in user-centered design users' involvement is not always direct and can be ascribed only to some stages of the process while co-design aims to be a continuous and fully shared process, where users' role cannot be disentangled from designer's.\n\n\n\nDesign Process and Methodology\nTLDR: Participatory design and co-design differ in their process structure and emphasis on user involvement. While participatory design involves users more deeply in idea generation and prototyping, co-design may have a broader interpretation of user input and can vary in its approach to prototyping.\n\nThe design processes and methodologies employed in participatory design and co-design reveal key differences in their approaches to user involvement and product development. Participatory design typically adheres to a more structured process that emphasizes deep user engagement throughout all stages, including idea generation and prototyping  (2, Hirsch et al., 2013). This approach ensures that users are actively involved in shaping the product from its earliest conceptual stages.\n\nIn contrast, co-design methodologies can vary more widely in their interpretation of user involvement. In some cases, particularly in service design contexts, co-design may consider any form of customer input during the design process as sufficient, which differs significantly from the more comprehensive user participation expected in participatory design  (2, Hirsch et al., 2013). This broader interpretation of co-design can lead to less intensive user involvement in certain stages of the design process.\n\nThe emphasis on prototyping also differs between these approaches. While participatory design consistently involves users in prototyping activities, some co-design methodologies, such as the Living Lab process, place a much greater emphasis on prototyping as a distinct phase (6, Vallentin-Holbech et al., 2021). The Living Lab approach, for instance, follows a more structured progression from concept design to prototype design and finally to innovation design, with prototyping playing a central role in the process.\n\nThese differences in process structure and user involvement highlight the unique characteristics of participatory design and co-design, offering designers and organizations different options for integrating user input into their design processes based on project goals and resource constraints.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(2, Hirsch et al., 2013) | n_citations: 11 | Probing bus stop for insights on transit co-design ]: \nco-design in service design appears different than co-design in participatory design... getting input from customers during a design process often seems to count as co-design, and this seems quite different than participatory design's expectation that users more materially participate in the idea generation and prototyping activities.\n\n2. [(6, Vallentin-Holbech et al., 2021) | n_citations: 22 | Co-creating Virtual Reality Interventions for Alcohol Prevention: Living Lab vs. Co-design ]: \nWhile the seven-step co-design process focusses on preparing for the specific co-design sessions with users and stakeholders through sensitization and facilitation, the Living Lab process is more focussed on the creation of an initial concept design, followed by a more concrete prototype design, and a more finalized innovation design... Taken together, the Living Lab process places much greater emphasis on prototyping than co-design.\n\n\n\nRelationship to Other Design Approaches\nTLDR: Participatory design and co-design are part of a broader spectrum of user-involving design approaches. They share similarities with and differ from other methodologies like user-centered design, offering varying degrees of user participation and empowerment.\n\n- Participatory Design:\n  - Distinguished from related approaches like User-Centered Design by its emphasis on active user participation throughout the design process [4 | 158873853 | DELL'ERA et al. | 2019 | Citations: 13].\n  - Focuses on deep user involvement and empowerment in all stages of design.\n\n- Co-Design:\n  - Draws on relevant approaches such as participatory design, collaborative design, and user-centered design  (8, Koutsabasis et al., 2022).\n  - Aims for a continuous and fully shared process where users' roles are deeply intertwined with designers'  (7, Antonini, 2021).\n\n- User-Centered Design:\n  - Shares the core principle of putting the user at the center of the design process with co-design and participatory design  (7, Antonini, 2021).\n  - Differs from co-design and participatory design in that user involvement may be less direct and limited to specific stages of the process  (7, Antonini, 2021).\n\n- Collaborative Design:\n  - Related to co-design, emphasizing cooperation between various stakeholders in the design process  (8, Koutsabasis et al., 2022).\n  - May not necessarily prioritize end-user involvement to the same extent as participatory design or co-design [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nUnderstanding these relationships helps designers choose the most appropriate approach based on project goals, resource constraints, and desired level of user involvement and empowerment.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This multi-method approach allows researchers to capture both observed behaviors and participant perspectives.\n\nObservational studies in systems research are frequently complemented by other research methodologies to enhance the depth and breadth of insights gained. A notable trend is the combination of observational techniques with interview methods. According to a comprehensive review by McDonald et al., observations were reported in 30.3% of the papers analyzed, and among these, the vast majority (81.6%) also incorporated interviews alongside observations  (18, MCDONALD, 2019). This combination allows researchers to not only observe user behaviors directly but also to gain insights into participants' thoughts, motivations, and explanations for their actions.\n\nThe choice between observational and experimental approaches in systems research depends on the specific research goals. Torino et al. explain that researchers can either follow experimental science principles to investigate cause-effect relationships through controlled experiments or adopt observational science principles to study systems in their natural, unperturbed state  (1, Torino et al., 0). The observational approach is particularly valuable when researchers aim to understand real-world usage patterns and user behaviors without introducing artificial interventions.\n\nIn practice, the integration of observational studies with other methods often involves careful documentation. Hansen et al. highlight the importance of taking extensive field notes during both interviews and observational studies  (12, Hansen et al., 2012). This meticulous record-keeping ensures that researchers capture rich, contextual data that can be analyzed alongside more structured data collection methods.\n\nBy combining observational studies with techniques such as interviews, surveys, or controlled experiments, researchers in systems papers can develop a more holistic understanding of user interactions, system performance, and the broader context in which technologies are deployed and used [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. This multi-method approach helps to validate findings, uncover unexpected insights, and address potential limitations of any single research methodology.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This approach aims to enhance user engagement and satisfaction by delivering relevant content while addressing challenges like filter bubbles and ethical concerns.\n\nAI-driven content curation in social media leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior, preferences, and interactions to personalize content feeds [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. This approach aims to enhance user engagement and satisfaction by delivering more relevant and interesting content to individual users. Social media platforms typically employ collaborative filtering techniques, which recommend content based on similarities between users' past behaviors and preferences [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nHowever, the implementation of AI-driven content curation faces several challenges. One significant concern is the creation of filter bubbles, where users are primarily exposed to content that aligns with their existing views and interests, potentially limiting exposure to diverse perspectives [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. To address this issue, content curation algorithms may incorporate mechanisms to introduce some level of content diversity while maintaining overall relevance.\n\nEthical considerations also play a crucial role in AI-driven content curation. Social media platforms must balance personalization with user privacy, ensuring that data collection and usage practices are transparent and comply with relevant regulations [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. Additionally, there is ongoing debate about the responsibility of platforms in moderating content and preventing the spread of misinformation through their recommendation algorithms.\n\nThe effectiveness of AI-driven content curation relies heavily on the quality and quantity of data collected about user interactions and preferences. Social media platforms typically gather data on various user actions, such as likes, shares, comments, and time spent viewing specific types of content [LLM MEMORY | 2024]. This data is then used to train and refine the machine learning models that power the curation algorithms.\n\nAs the field of AI continues to advance, new techniques and approaches for content curation are being developed and refined. These may include more sophisticated natural language processing to better understand content context and sentiment, as well as improved methods for balancing personalization with content diversity [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nData collection for personalization\nTLDR: Social media platforms collect diverse user data to personalize content feeds. This data includes explicit user actions, implicit behaviors, and contextual information, forming the foundation for AI-driven content curation algorithms.\n\n\u2022 User interactions: Social media platforms gather data on explicit user actions such as likes, shares, comments, and reactions to posts. These direct interactions provide clear signals about user preferences and interests [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n\u2022 Time spent viewing content: The duration a user spends looking at specific types of content is tracked and analyzed. This implicit behavior can indicate interest levels even without explicit interactions [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n\u2022 Search history: Users' search queries within the platform are logged and used to understand their current interests and information needs [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n\u2022 Profile information: Demographic data, interests, and other details provided in user profiles contribute to personalization efforts [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n\u2022 Device and location data: Information about the devices used to access the platform and users' geographical locations can influence content recommendations [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n\u2022 Network connections: Data on a user's friends, followers, and the accounts they follow helps in understanding their social circle and potential interests [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n\u2022 Content engagement patterns: The types of content a user frequently engages with, including text, images, videos, or links, are analyzed to refine recommendations [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n\u2022 Temporal patterns: The times of day and days of the week when users are most active on the platform are considered for optimizing content delivery [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n\u2022 Cross-platform data: Some platforms may use data from connected services or third-party sources to enhance their understanding of user preferences [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n\u2022 Feedback loops: User responses to recommended content, including skips, dismissals, or engagement, are continuously monitored to improve the personalization algorithm [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n"}
{"case_id": "e307068003936acfd8f82207c67e25bb", "answer_text": "Advantages of 3 DOF in Quadruped Robot Legs\nTLDR: Three degrees of freedom (DOF) in quadruped robot legs offer enhanced maneuverability and versatility. This configuration allows for more complex movements, better terrain adaptation, and improved overall performance compared to simpler designs.\n\nQuadruped robots typically use 3 DOF for each leg due to the significant advantages this configuration provides in terms of mobility and functionality. The most basic leg design requires at least two DOF - one for lifting and one for swinging - but the addition of a third DOF greatly enhances the robot's capabilities  (6, Manoonpong et al., 2020). This three-joint structure usually consists of a vertical joint controlling leg orientation and two horizontal joints managing elevation and extension  (2, GRAND et al., 2014).\n\nThe 3 DOF configuration allows quadruped robots to achieve superior performance by enabling more complex and precise movements. With this setup, robots can produce straight-line foot trajectories relative to their body, which is crucial for efficient locomotion  (3, Khudher et al., 2016). Additionally, the 3 DOF design typically incorporates hip abduction/adduction, hip flexion/extension, and knee flexion/extension, providing a wide range of motion that closely mimics the leg structure of many animals  (9, Kim et al., 2023)  (11, Ames et al., 2023).\n\nOne of the key benefits of 3 DOF legs is the ability to generate 3D forces at the robot's toes in most configurations, offering a good balance between capability, weight, and power density (10, Rozen-Levy et al., 2023). This increased maneuverability allows quadruped robots to adapt to various terrains and perform complex tasks that would be challenging or impossible with fewer DOF.\n\nFurthermore, the added flexibility of 3 DOF legs contributes to improved overall performance. Quadruped robots with this configuration can achieve faster walking speeds, require lower driving torque, and maintain a smaller footprint compared to those with 2 DOF legs  (8, Jisha et al., 2022). The low inertia of these legs also ensures more agile and reliable gaits  (9, Kim et al., 2023).\n\nIt's important to note that while 3 DOF legs offer numerous advantages, they also introduce additional complexity in terms of control and power consumption  (6, Manoonpong et al., 2020). However, the benefits in terms of versatility and performance generally outweigh these challenges, making 3 DOF the preferred configuration for many quadruped robot designs  (5, Zufaryansyah et al., 2019).\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(5, Zufaryansyah et al., 2019) | n_citations: 7 | Development of a quadruped mobile robot and its movement system using geometric-based inverse kinematics ]: \nThe study is related to the movement of a four-legged (quadruped) mobile robot with three Degrees of Freedom (3 DOF) for each leg. Because it has four legs, the movement of the robot can only be done through coordinating the movements of each leg.\n\n\n\nDisadvantages of 2 DOF in Quadruped Robot Legs\nTLDR: Two degrees of freedom (DOF) in quadruped robot legs significantly limit mobility and control capabilities. This configuration restricts the robot's ability to navigate complex terrains and perform advanced maneuvers, making it less versatile compared to 3 DOF designs.\n\nWhile 2 DOF legs in quadruped robots offer simplicity in design and control, they come with several notable disadvantages that limit their overall performance and versatility. The primary limitation of 2 DOF legs is their restricted range of motion. With only two degrees of freedom, typically one for lifting and one for swinging, these robots lack the additional maneuvering capabilities provided by a third DOF  (6, Manoonpong et al., 2020).\n\nOne of the most significant drawbacks of 2 DOF legs is the inability to control body angles and lateral motion. As noted by Youm et al., \"Since our quadruped robot has only 2-d.o.f. for each leg, the body angle and lateral motion are not controllable\"  (1, Youm et al., 2008). This limitation severely restricts the robot's ability to maintain balance and navigate uneven terrain, making it less adaptable to diverse environments.\n\nFurthermore, 2 DOF legs result in reduced walking speed, higher driving torque requirements, and a larger footprint compared to their 3 DOF counterparts  (8, Jisha et al., 2022). These factors contribute to less efficient locomotion and potentially higher energy consumption, despite the simpler mechanical design.\n\nIt's worth noting that while 2 DOF legs have limitations, they are not entirely without merit. As Angelico et al. point out, there is a spectrum of complexity in leg design, ranging from the minimalist 1 DOF approach seen in the RHex robot to more complex 4+ DOF configurations  (12, Angelico et al., 2023). However, 2 DOF legs often fall short in providing the optimal balance between simplicity and functionality that 3 DOF legs offer.\n\nIn conclusion, while 2 DOF legs in quadruped robots may seem attractive due to their simpler design, the significant limitations in mobility, control, and adaptability make them less suitable for applications requiring versatile and efficient locomotion in varied environments.\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "050725a9a16e6694b491f735c63ace96", "answer_text": "Material Selection Considerations\nTLDR: Material selection for industrial robotic grippers involves balancing factors like elasticity, durability, and grip strength. Both soft materials like silicone elastomers and rigid materials like thermoplastic polyurethane are used, with recent trends favoring softer, more compliant materials for versatile gripping.\n\nThe selection of materials for industrial robotic grippers is a critical consideration that significantly impacts their performance and functionality. Traditionally, rigid materials such as metals and hard plastics have been used in robotic grippers  (44, Allahverdizade et al., 2023). However, recent advancements have led to an increased focus on softer, more compliant materials, particularly in the development of soft robotic grippers.\n\nSoft components commonly used in gripper actuators include urethanes, hydrogels, braided fabrics, hydraulic fluidics, and polymers, with silicone elastomers being particularly popular  (12, Armada et al., 2021). The physical and chemical properties of these materials play a crucial role in the design and functionality of soft grippers  (17, Hemadri et al., 2021). For instance, silicone elastomers are often chosen for their flexibility and ability to conform to various object shapes.\n\nIn some cases, designers are experimenting with composite materials to achieve specific properties. For example, Ives et al. developed a soft robotic gripper using a mix of 70% pristine EcoFlex 00-30 silicone elastomer and 30% recycled EcoFlex 00-30 granules  (40, Ives et al., 2023). This approach demonstrates the potential for incorporating recycled materials in gripper fabrication, which could have implications for sustainability in robotics manufacturing.\n\nWhile soft materials offer advantages in terms of adaptability and safety, they may have limitations in grip strength and precision. To address this, some researchers are exploring hybrid approaches that combine soft and rigid elements. For instance, Webb et al. developed a gripper using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) with a shore hardness of 95A, striking a balance between firmness for supporting grasped objects and softness for compliant movement  (43, Webb et al., 2023).\n\nThe choice of material also affects the gripper's surface properties, which are crucial for effective grasping. Researchers have noted that flat, rigid contact surfaces can lead to low grip traction, causing objects to slip easily  (28, Seng et al., 2022). To overcome this, some designs incorporate novel surface features, such as hairy pads or air-filled membranes, to enhance gripping capabilities  (43, Webb et al., 2023)  (18, Beaulieu et al., 2021).\n\nIn conclusion, material selection for industrial robotic grippers involves careful consideration of properties such as elasticity, durability, grip strength, and surface characteristics. The trend towards softer, more compliant materials reflects the industry's focus on developing versatile grippers capable of handling a wide range of objects safely and efficiently. However, the optimal choice often depends on the specific application requirements, leading to ongoing research into various material combinations and innovative designs.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The gripping pads and hair patterns are made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), with shore hardness 95A via fused deposition modeling (3D printed).This strikes a balance between firmness, so that the hairs can support grasped objects and retain their shape, and softness, so that the gripper can move seamlessly in tight spaces with the hairs deforming in compliance to allow objects inside the gripper with no disturbance.\n\n6.

While a variety of popular material technologies have been investigated toward creating soft skins for manipulatorselastomers (e.g., silicone, shape memory materials, active polymers and gels) being popular examples... an extension of these approaches is to utilize air-filled membranes as the surfaces and end-effectors of rigid links.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Soft Gripper Materials\nTLDR: Soft gripper materials offer superior compliance, adaptability, and safety for handling diverse objects. They excel in grasping fragile or irregularly shaped items, while providing improved friction and wear resistance.\n\n1. Enhanced compliance and adaptability: Soft grippers can conform to various object shapes, making them highly versatile for grasping irregularly shaped or delicate items  (6, Kuppuswamy et al., 2020)  (21, Yeong et al., 2022).\n\n2. Improved safety and interaction: The inherent compliance of soft materials allows for safer interaction with fragile objects compared to rigid grippers  (32, Chai et al., 2023).\n\n3. Higher friction and better grasps: Soft materials often provide increased friction at contact points, leading to more secure and stable grasps  (6, Kuppuswamy et al., 2020).\n\n4. Simplicity and lightweight design: Soft grippers can be designed to be simpler and lighter than traditional rigid grippers, potentially reducing complexity and cost  (13, Chua et al., 2021)  (23, Fang et al., 2022).\n\n5. Robustness and durability: Some soft materials show improved resistance to wear-and-tear, potentially increasing the longevity of the gripper  (6, Kuppuswamy et al., 2020).\n\n6. Minimal actuation force: Soft grippers often require less force to initiate grasping, making them energy-efficient and gentler on objects  (30, Zhao et al., 2023).\n\n7. Versatility in object manipulation: Beyond static grasping, soft grippers can be used for various object manipulation tasks  (11, Zareinejad et al., 2020).\n\n8. High payload capacity: Despite their softness, some designs can achieve excellent grasping strength, with the ability to lift objects many times their own weight  (16, Che et al., 2021).\n\n9. Integration of functional materials: Soft grippers can incorporate functional materials with unique properties, enhancing their capabilities for specific applications  (32, Chai et al., 2023).\n\n10. Variable stiffness: Some soft gripper designs can adjust their stiffness, allowing for both gentle handling and increased gripping strength when needed  (30, Zhao et al., 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(6, Kuppuswamy et al., 2020) | n_citations: 67 | Soft-bubble grippers for robust and perceptive manipulation ]: \n(i) a large degree of compliance through a combination of pneumatic effects and membrane elasticity... (ii) the resulting higher friction at the contact patch leads to better grasps, (iii) they are potentially more robust to wear-and-tear from longterm use.\n\n2. [(21, Yeong et al., 2022) | n_citations: 39 | 3D Printing of Robotic Soft Grippers: Toward Smart Actuation and Sensing ]: \nUnlike traditional hard grippers, soft robotic grippers are commonly made of soft materials so that the soft grippers can produce motion via elastic deformations of their compliant components... One advantage of the soft grippers is that the flexible gripping surfaces guarantee that there is maximum compliance to the object being grasped, thus improving the grasping of any oddly shaped objects... High porosity levels are not desirable in soft grippers as high porosity reduces the fatigue resistance, which leads to a short lifespan of the grippers.\n\n3. [(32, Chai et al., 2023) | n_citations: 6 | Soft-rigid coupling grippers: Collaboration strategies and integrated fabrication methods ]: \nGenerally speaking, due to the inherent compliance of soft matter, the interaction capability with fragile objects could be guaranteed compared with the rigid grippers whose contact stiffness is usually large, and yet the forcebearing capacity of soft grippers is weak...

[(16, Che et al., 2021) | n_citations: 13 | A Soft-Rigid Hybrid Gripper With Lateral Compliance and Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation ]: \nSoft grippers are receiving growing attention due to their compliance-based interactive safety and dexterity... With rigid structural components actuated by soft actuators, they could achieve excellent grasping adaptability and payload while also being easy to model and control with conventional kinematics... With very lightweight pneumatic bellows soft actuators, the gripper could grasp objects over 20 times its weight with lateral compliance.\n\n\n\nDisadvantages of Soft Gripper Materials\nTLDR: Soft gripper materials, while offering many advantages, come with significant drawbacks including limited force output, unpredictable deformation, and potential durability issues. These limitations can affect grasping stability, payload capacity, and overall lifespan of the gripper.\n\n1. Reduced force output: Soft grippers typically generate lower grasping forces compared to their rigid counterparts, potentially limiting their ability to handle heavy loads  (22, Zhang et al., 2022).\n\n2. Unpredictable deformation: The inherent flexibility of soft materials can lead to slightly unpredictable deformations during grasping, making precise control more challenging  (22, Zhang et al., 2022).\n\n3. Increased nonlinearity: Soft components often exhibit nonlinear behavior, complicating the modeling and control of the gripper  (22, Zhang et al., 2022).\n\n4. Undesired out-of-plane deformation: The high flexibility of soft materials and structures can result in unwanted deformations that reduce grasping stability  (24, Tian et al., 2022).\n\n5. Limited payload capacity: Some soft materials, like Ecoflex30, may be too soft to withstand large pressures, resulting in small finger forces and limited ability to handle heavy loads  (1, ZHANG, 0).\n\n6. Continuous pressure control: Many soft grippers require constant pressure management to maintain appropriate grasp forces, potentially increasing complexity and energy consumption  (5, Wen et al., 2019).\n\n7. Durability concerns: The use of softer materials may decrease the lifespan of the gripper components, particularly when subjected to repeated stress or heavy loads  (22, Zhang et al., 2022).\n\n8. Trade-off between softness and structural integrity: While increasing stiffness can improve load-bearing capacity, it may negatively impact safety and conformability to object shapes  (5, Wen et al., 2019).\n\n9. Limited precision: The inherent compliance of soft materials may make it challenging to achieve high-precision grasping or manipulation tasks [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n10. Environmental sensitivity: Soft materials may be more susceptible to environmental factors such as temperature changes or chemical exposure, potentially affecting their performance and longevity [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1. [(22, Zhang et al., 2022) | n_citations: 20 | Anthropomorphic Twisted String-Actuated Soft Robotic Gripper With Tendon-Based Stiffening ]: \nHowever, none of the previously developed robotic grippers were fabricated using completely soft material... the inherent limitations of using soft materials, namely, (1) slightly unpredictable deformation of the material, (2) increased nonlinearity of the components, and (3) low force outputs in comparison to rigid grippers, naturally appear in the proposed gripper... using a softer material would also make the gripper less structured, potentially decreasing the lifespan of the silicone and the weight that can be supported by the gripper\n\n2. [(24, Tian et al., 2022) | n_citations: 5 | Optimizing Out-of-Plane Stiffness for Soft Grippers ]: \nHowever, the high flexibility of materials (with low Young's modulus) and structures (with low stiffness) used on soft grippers can also lead to undesired out-of-plane deformation, which reduces grasping stability\n\n3. [(1, ZHANG, 0) | n_citations: 4 | 3D Printed Soft Robot Gripper with Closed-Loop Control ]: \nEcoflex30 is too soft to withstand large pressures, so the force on the fingers is small and cannot stand heavy load.\n\n4.

In contrast, many soft grippers require pressure to be continuously controlled so that appropriate grasp forces may be applied.\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Rigid Gripper Materials\nTLDR: Rigid gripper materials offer superior strength and stability for heavy payloads. They provide precise and secure grasping for specific tasks, though at the cost of versatility.\n\n1. High load-bearing capacity: Rigid grippers are capable of handling heavy objects due to their stiff structure, making them ideal for industrial applications requiring the manipulation of substantial payloads  (2, Jentoft et al., 2013).\n\n2. Secure grasping: The rigidity of these grippers allows for a more secure hold on objects, particularly when optimized for specific payloads  (27, Voos et al., 2022).\n\n3. Precision in manipulation: The inherent stiffness of rigid materials enables more precise control and positioning of grasped objects [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n4. Durability: Rigid materials often have higher resistance to wear and tear, potentially leading to longer operational lifespans in industrial settings [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n5. Predictable behavior: The consistent properties of rigid materials make their performance more predictable and easier to model in robotic control systems [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n6. High-speed operation: The stiffness of rigid grippers allows for faster acceleration and deceleration during object manipulation tasks [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n7. Resistance to environmental factors: Many rigid materials used in grippers are less susceptible to temperature changes or chemical exposure compared to softer alternatives [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n8. Cost-effectiveness for specific tasks: When designed for particular payloads, rigid grippers can be highly efficient and cost-effective for repetitive industrial tasks  (27, Voos et al., 2022).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(2, Jentoft et al., 2013) | n_citations: 503 | A compliant, underactuated hand for robust manipulation ]: \nDue to higher-order elastic deformations, such as the rubber finger pads and the internal deformation modes in the flexure joint, the power grasp will not be infinitely stiff, but it will be sufficient to hold even heavy objects.\n\n2. [(27, Voos et al., 2022) | n_citations: 3 | TRIGGER: A Lightweight Universal Jamming Gripper for Aerial Grasping ]: \nAs a rule of thumb, rigid grippers are less versatile since they are made for specific payloads... heavier due to mechanical joints, but in turn, can provide a more secure grasp for the payloads they are optimized for.\n\n\n\nDisadvantages of Rigid Gripper Materials\nTLDR: Rigid gripper materials have limitations in adaptability and contact area, which can lead to reduced grasping stability and force. They also lack the flexibility needed for complex manipulations and handling objects with varying geometries.\n\n1. Limited contact area: Rigid grippers, particularly fingered designs, often have smaller contact areas with objects compared to soft or enveloping grippers. This can result in reduced grasping force and lower stability when subjected to external disturbances  (31, Hao et al., 2023).\n\n2. Poor adaptability to object variations: Rigid grippers struggle to adapt to objects with varying surface geometries, limiting their versatility in handling diverse parts  (34, Hartisch et al., 2023).\n\n3. Lack of flexibility for in-hand manipulation: The rigidity of these grippers makes it difficult to achieve the flexibility required for complex in-hand object manipulations  (3, Rahman et al., 2017).\n\n4. Potential for object damage: The lack of compliance in rigid materials increases the risk of damaging delicate or fragile objects during grasping and manipulation [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n5. Limited grip on smooth or irregular surfaces: Rigid grippers may struggle to maintain a secure hold on objects with smooth or irregular surfaces due to their inability to conform to these shapes [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n6. Reduced safety in human-robot collaboration: The stiffness of rigid grippers can pose safety concerns in environments where robots interact closely with human workers [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n7. Complexity in design for versatility: To overcome limitations in adaptability, rigid grippers often require more complex designs or additional mechanisms, potentially increasing cost and maintenance requirements  (34, Hartisch et al., 2023).\n\n8. Energy inefficiency: Rigid grippers may require more force and energy to securely grasp objects, especially when dealing with objects of varying sizes and shapes [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n9. Noise generation: The operation of rigid grippers, particularly in high-speed applications, can potentially generate more noise compared to softer alternatives [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\n10. Limited sensor integration: The rigid structure can make it more challenging to integrate advanced sensing capabilities for improved object detection and manipulation feedback [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1.

However, in-hand manipulation of objects urges certain degrees of flexibility in the gripper design; which is difficult to obtain from a rigid structure and also the use of non-rigid materials reduce speed, accuracy and performance.\n\n\n\nHybrid Approaches: Combining Soft and Rigid Materials\nTLDR: Hybrid grippers combine soft and rigid materials to leverage the advantages of both, offering adaptability and strength. These designs use various mechanisms like variable stiffness, bistable structures, and composite materials to achieve versatile and effective grasping.\n\nHybrid approaches in robotic gripper design aim to combine the benefits of both soft and rigid materials, addressing the limitations of each while capitalizing on their strengths. This synergy allows for grippers that can adapt to various object shapes while maintaining the ability to handle heavier loads and perform precise manipulations.\n\nOne notable approach involves the use of variable stiffness mechanisms. Tan et al. developed a soft robotic manipulation system that incorporates low melting point alloy within soft elastomers, allowing for stiffness variation and dexterous operations  (14, Tan et al., 2021). Similarly, Sariyildiz et al. designed a soft gripper with fingers that can change their stiffness through pressure regulation, enabling adjustable grasping force  (35, Sariyildiz et al., 2023).\n\nAnother innovative design combines soft structures with rigid components to enhance performance. Sun et al. created a gripper that uses a spring mechanism to amplify bending stiffness for grasping heavy objects  (4, Sun et al., 2018). Xiong et al. employed semirigid plastic sheets as \"nails\" within soft fingers, improving the gripper's ability to handle limp objects  (33, Xiong et al., 2023).\n\nSome researchers have explored bistable structures and smart materials in hybrid designs. Jawed et al. developed a soft gripper incorporating a bistable dome with Kirigami layers and a shape memory alloy spring, combining flexibility with rapid actuation  (37, Jawed et al., 2023). Luo et al. created a gripper with significantly higher stiffness and load capacity compared to conventional soft grippers, capable of lifting objects up to 220 times its mass  (36, Luo et al., 2023).\n\nThe integration of soft materials with traditional rigid grippers has also shown promise. Bartlett et al. mounted soft controllable adhesives on standard rigid grippers, enabling a diverse range of grasping capabilities  (25, Bartlett et al., 2022). This approach, termed RISO (Rigid-Soft) grippers, allows for both purely rigid and purely soft grasping modes.\n\nThe design of hybrid grippers often involves careful consideration of material properties and structural elements. Qiu et al. noted that increasing the number of crossbeams in a Fin-Ray structure can provide stable grasping for rigid objects but may pose challenges when handling soft or fragile items  (39, Qiu et al., 2023). Kormushev et al. highlighted the importance of balancing compliance in underactuated grippers, particularly when dealing with delicate or articulated objects  (38, Kormushev et al., 2023).\n\nHybrid approaches also extend to the incorporation of novel materials and structures. Liu et al. discussed the use of jamming granular materials and the embedding of skeletal structures in soft robots to achieve a balance of compliance and rigidity  (45, Liu et al., 2023). These innovations demonstrate the ongoing efforts to create grippers that can adapt to various object shapes while maintaining strength and precision.\n\nThe advantages of hybrid designs are evident in their ability to combine the adaptability of soft grippers with the strength and precision of rigid ones  (8, Liu et al., 2020)  (15, Pan et al., 2021). This fusion of technologies allows for passive compliance and underactuation, simplifying control during grasping tasks  (20, ODOR et al., 2021)  (29, Vatsal et al., 2022).\n\nIn conclusion, hybrid approaches in robotic gripper design represent a promising direction for achieving versatile, efficient, and safe grasping in industrial applications. By combining soft and rigid materials, researchers are developing grippers that can adapt to a wide range of objects while maintaining the strength and precision required for industrial tasks.\n\nReferences:\n1.

They allow for objective comparisons between different control architectures and algorithms  (42, Valencia et al., 2010). Benchmark suites like Arena-bench incorporate a variety of these metrics to assess navigational safety, robustness, path quality, and efficiency  (2, Fatloun et al., 2022).

These scenarios are designed to test various aspects of robot performance, including navigation in cluttered spaces, interaction with moving obstacles, and real-world applicability.\n\nExperimental scenarios for evaluating obstacle avoidance strategies in mobile robots typically encompass a wide range of complexity and realism. These scenarios are crucial for assessing the effectiveness and robustness of different algorithms under various conditions.\n\nSimple scenarios often start with static obstacles of basic geometric shapes. These tests help establish a baseline for algorithm performance and are useful for initial validation  (66, SALAAM et al., 2014). As complexity increases, scenarios may include multiple static obstacles in different configurations, challenging the robot's ability to navigate through cluttered environments  (182, Guo et al., 2022).\n\nDynamic obstacle scenarios are particularly important for evaluating real-world applicability. These may involve single or multiple moving obstacles with varying speeds and trajectories  (272, Zhang et al., 2024). Such scenarios test the robot's ability to predict and avoid collisions in real-time, which is crucial for deployment in dynamic environments like crowded public spaces.\n\nSimulated environments play a significant role in experimental scenarios. Platforms like V-REP allow researchers to create and test multiple scenarios efficiently, comparing different algorithms under controlled conditions  (240, Cao et al., 2023). Similarly, the ROS platform is often used to simulate realistic scenarios and compare the performance of various obstacle avoidance approaches  (144, Weng et al., 2021).\n\nReal-world experiments complement simulations by introducing the complexities of actual environments. These may include tests in office-like settings or outdoor spaces, where robots must navigate around furniture, walls, and unpredictable human movements  (144, Weng et al., 2021).\n\nSome researchers design specific application-oriented scenarios to evaluate obstacle avoidance strategies. For instance, a simulated social event where a robot acts as a waiter, navigating between tables and avoiding dynamic obstacles, provides a practical test case for potential real-world applications  (139, Cerbaro et al., 2020).\n\nBy employing a diverse range of experimental scenarios, from simple static obstacles to complex dynamic environments and real-world settings, researchers can comprehensively evaluate and compare different obstacle avoidance strategies for mobile robots. This approach ensures that the developed algorithms are robust and capable of handling various challenges they may encounter in practical applications.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods aim to evaluate different algorithms across various scenarios, considering factors such as safety, efficiency, and path quality.\n\nComparison methodologies for obstacle avoidance strategies in mobile robots typically involve a combination of simulation-based evaluations and real-world experiments. Simulations allow researchers to test algorithms in controlled environments, while real-world tests validate performance under practical conditions  (140, Ellis et al., 2020).\n\nMany studies compare novel algorithms against established methods to demonstrate improvements. For instance, Koren et al. compared their Vector Field Histogram (VFH) method to earlier approaches using experimental results from a mobile robot navigating densely cluttered obstacle courses  (5, Koren et al., 1991). Similarly, Sathiya et al. compared their proposed techniques (NSGA-II and MODE) against existing methods for optimal motion design of differential-driven wheeled mobile robots  (107, Sathiya et al., 2019).\n\nPerformance metrics play a crucial role in these comparisons. Common metrics include success rate, navigation time, path length, and energy consumption  (167, Wang, 2021)  (132, Mathew et al., 2020). Some studies focus on specific aspects, such as runtime performance, constraint evaluation time, and planning time  (273, Vasudevan et al., 2024).\n\nResearchers often design various test scenarios to evaluate algorithm performance comprehensively. These may include static obstacles, dynamic environments, and multi-robot scenarios  (274, Hoshino et al., 2024)  (238, Srikanthan et al., 2023). Zhang et al., for example, compared their APSO algorithm against A*, PRM, RRT, and Bi-RRT in static path planning scenarios  (217, Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nComparative studies often use popular robotics platforms and tools. The GeRoNa framework has been used to compare novel approaches with classical methods like Potential Field and Dynamic Window Approach  (96, Zell et al., 2018). Other studies have utilized ROS (Robot Operating System) for simulations and comparisons [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nSome researchers focus on specific aspects of performance, such as smoothness of robot motion and memory utilization  (47, Abbas et al., 2011). Others compare algorithms in terms of time consumption and trajectory lengths  (127, Ding et al., 2020).\n\nReal-world experiments are often conducted to validate simulation results and assess practical applicability. Kulich et al. compared three obstacle avoidance algorithms in both simulated environments and with a real robot in the SyRotek system  (75, Kulich et al., 2015).\n\nIn summary, comparison methodologies for obstacle avoidance strategies in mobile robots involve a multi-faceted approach, combining simulations, real-world experiments, and various performance metrics. This comprehensive evaluation helps researchers and developers assess the effectiveness of different algorithms across diverse scenarios and identify areas for improvement in mobile robot navigation and obstacle avoidance.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These include swarm intelligence, evolutionary algorithms, and neural network approaches, each offering unique strengths in solving complex navigation problems.\n\nBiologically-inspired algorithms have become increasingly popular in robot path planning due to their ability to solve complex optimization problems efficiently. These algorithms draw inspiration from natural processes and behaviors observed in living organisms, offering innovative solutions to navigation challenges  (31, Volodymyr, 2022). The field of biologically-inspired path planning encompasses a diverse range of approaches, including swarm intelligence, evolutionary algorithms, and neural network-based methods  (18, Yang et al., 2019).\n\nSwarm intelligence algorithms, which mimic the collective behavior of social animals, are particularly prominent in this domain. These include ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and more recent additions like the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and cuckoo optimization algorithm  (35, Hason et al., 2023)  (309, Bhusan et al., 2023). These methods excel at finding optimal paths by simulating the interactions of simple agents within a swarm  (31, Volodymyr, 2022).\n\nEvolutionary algorithms, inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics, form another important category.

The main strengths and challenges of path planning methods employed by researchers were identified and discussed.\n\n\n\nSwarm Intelligence-Based Algorithms\nTLDR: Swarm intelligence algorithms, inspired by collective behaviors in nature, are widely used for robot path planning. Popular approaches include Ant Colony Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, and newer methods like Firefly Algorithm and Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm.\n\nSwarm intelligence-based algorithms draw inspiration from the collective behaviors of social animals and insects to solve complex optimization problems in robot path planning. These methods have gained popularity due to their ability to find efficient solutions in dynamic environments. Some of the most widely used swarm intelligence algorithms for robot path planning include:\n\n1. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO): This algorithm mimics the foraging behavior of ants, using artificial pheromones to mark potential paths  (8, Vinchurkar et al., 2013). ACO has been successfully applied to various path planning scenarios, with recent improvements focusing on enhancing convergence speed and global optimization performance  (40, Zheng et al., 2023).\n\n2. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): Inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking, PSO has been extensively used for robot path planning  (19, Liao et al., 2019). It has been combined with other algorithms to improve performance, such as the hybrid RFD-PSO algorithm that balances fast convergence with adaptive exploration  (39, Hassen, 2023).\n\n3. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC): This algorithm simulates the foraging behavior of honey bees and has been applied to path planning problems  (9, Pal et al., 2013). An improved version, NMABC, introduces novel mechanisms for initial path generation and neighborhood search  (319, Li et al., 2023).\n\n4. Firefly Algorithm (FA): Based on the flashing behavior of fireflies, FA has been used for optimizing group behavior in multi-robot systems  (10, Kim et al., 2013).\n\n5. Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA): This newer algorithm draws inspiration from the swarming behavior of grasshoppers and has shown promise in mobile robot path planning and obstacle avoidance  (38, Sharma et al., 2023).\n\n6. Dragonfly Algorithm (DA): Inspired by the static and dynamic swarming behaviors of dragonflies, DA has been employed for navigation in unknown cluttered environments  (17, Muthukumaran et al., 2019).\n\n7. Cuckoo-Beetle Swarm Search (CBSS): This algorithm combines the biological habits of cuckoos and beetle herds, offering good robustness and global optimization ability  (28, Chen et al., 2022).\n\n8. Crow Swarm Optimization (CSO): CSO has shown promising results in path planning, outperforming PSO and ACO in some comparisons  (25, Salim et al., 2021).\n\nResearchers have also developed hybrid approaches that combine multiple swarm intelligence algorithms or integrate them with other optimization techniques. For example, a hybrid model using graph-based search with ACO has demonstrated superior performance in various environments  (22, Luo et al., 2020). Similarly, combining PSO with the ant colony algorithm has shown improved results in finding optimal paths  (15, Xu et al., 2017).\n\nThe field of swarm intelligence-based path planning continues to evolve, with new algorithms being developed and existing ones being improved. Recent studies have proposed classifications and comparisons of these algorithms, helping researchers and practitioners choose the most suitable method for their specific robot path planning problems  (33, Yang et al., 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods simulate natural selection and evolution to optimize paths, offering solutions for both static and dynamic environments.\n\n1. Genetic Algorithms (GA): GAs are the most common evolutionary approach used in robot path planning. They simulate biological evolution to find optimal paths  (83, Wainwright et al., 2007). GAs can generate collision-free paths in both static and dynamic environments, often optimizing for the shortest distance  (66, Yang et al., 2003).\n\n2. GA with Bezier Curves: This approach combines genetic algorithms with Bezier curves to create smooth paths for mobile robots. The GA searches for optimal control points that determine the Bezier curve-based path  (169, Wang et al., 2016).\n\n3. GA for Global Path Planning: GAs can be used for global path planning, finding optimal paths in static environments represented by maps with nodes and links  (70, Nagib et al., 2004).\n\n4. Improved Genetic Algorithms: These incorporate additional techniques to enhance GA performance. For example, Obstacle Avoidance Algorithms (OAA) and Distinguish Algorithms (DA) can be used to generate initial populations, improving efficiency by selecting only feasible paths during evolution  (106, Yun et al., 2010).\n\n5. Continuous Path Planning: GAs can be implemented for continuous path planning, where the path is updated in response to environmental changes, such as moving obstacles. This approach has been applied in robotics competitions like RoboCup  (79, Salomon et al., 2006).\n\nEvolutionary algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms, offer a flexible and robust approach to robot path planning. Their ability to handle complex environments and adapt to changing conditions makes them a valuable tool in the field of robotics [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1.

Hereby, the path is updated to environmental changes, such as moving obstacles.\n\n\n\nNeural Network-Based Approaches\nTLDR: Neural network-based approaches offer innovative solutions for robot path planning, inspired by biological neural systems. These methods can learn complex navigation strategies, avoid local minima, and adapt to dynamic environments.\n\nNeural network-based approaches have emerged as a powerful tool in biologically-inspired robot path planning, offering the ability to learn and adapt to complex environments. These methods draw inspiration from the structure and function of biological neural systems, providing robust solutions to navigation challenges.\n\nOne notable approach uses biologically-motivated neural networks (BNN) for autonomous robot navigation. This method, inspired by Grossberg's model of biological neural systems, guides robots to reach goals while avoiding obstacles. The BNN-based scheme has demonstrated the ability to overcome the issue of local minima in path planning, a common problem in traditional algorithms  (12, Luo et al., 2014).\n\nAnother innovative technique involves the use of neural activity propagation to generate smooth and continuous paths. In this approach, the robot is attracted to the target through neural activity, while obstacles create valleys in the activity landscape to ensure collision avoidance. Simulations have shown that this method can generate paths that are not only smooth and obstacle-free but also capable of responding quickly to rapidly changing environments (2, Qi-zhi, 2006).\n\nDeep learning techniques have also been applied to robot path planning. For instance, a collision avoidance D* algorithm trained using a convolutional neural network enables mobile robots to learn from their experiences. This approach analyzes 30x30 map information of the environment, allowing the robot to navigate based on situation analysis through deep learning  (27, Brosalin et al., 2021).\n\nSome researchers have explored the use of multiple neural networks for different aspects of path planning. One such method employs two neural networks: the first determines the \"free\" space using ultrasound range finder data, while the second finds a safe direction for the next robot path section while avoiding nearby obstacles  (69, Janglova, 2004).\n\nHybrid approaches combining neural networks with other optimization techniques have also shown promise. For example, an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method based on a bio-inspired neural network has been proposed to optimize the fitness function of PSO-based methods  (16, Ni et al., 2017).\n\nRecent advancements in neural network-based navigation have demonstrated improvements over traditional methods such as potential fields. These new approaches based on artificial intelligence can solve some typical problems associated with older methods, offering more efficient and adaptable navigation strategies  (334, Perez et al., 2024).\n\nOverall, neural network-based approaches for robot path planning offer significant advantages in terms of adaptability, learning capability, and performance in complex and dynamic environments. As research in this field continues to evolve, these biologically-inspired methods are likely to play an increasingly important role in advancing robot navigation capabilities.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These include biomimetic robot designs, virtual force models, and chemical synapse-inspired navigation systems.\n\n1. Biomimetic Robot Designs: Researchers have developed path planning algorithms inspired by specific animal locomotion. For example, the Modified-Critical-SnakeBug (MCSB) algorithm is based on centipede movement, designed for multi-legged robots navigating complex environments  (20, Dutta et al., 2019).\n\n2. Virtual Force Models: Inspired by natural creature behaviors, some approaches use virtual attractive and repulsive forces to guide robot movement. This method allows robots to maintain safe distances from obstacles while moving towards their goals  (5, Choi et al., 2011).\n\n3. Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm (ISpSA): This algorithm, along with the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), falls under the category of Bio-inspired Population-based Optimization (BPO) methods, which have been applied to mobile robot path planning challenges  (42, Rahiman et al., 2024).\n\n4. Lattice-Based Planning: Some researchers have explored lattice-based, greedy breadth-first search through a robot's gait control space, incorporating motion models of available robot gaits to design controlled locomotion trajectories  (37, Vikas et al., 2023).\n\n5. Artificial Potential Field (APF) Integration: The APF method has been combined with other algorithms, such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), to improve path planning performance. This integration helps guide the overall planning path of the ant colony  (41, Xie et al., 2023).\n\n6. Simulated Annealing (SA): Along with Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colony Optimization, SA represents a broader range of naturally inspired physical processes applied to mobile robotic path planning  (14, Mo et al., 2014).\n\n7. Chemical Synapse-Inspired Navigation: Recent research has demonstrated the potential of using models of chemical synapses, such as the LTC model, for autonomous navigation of both cars and drones  (317, Grosu et al., 2023).\n\n8.

These methods include compressive sensing, modulated wideband converters, and random demodulation, enabling efficient sampling of sparse or structured signals.\n\nSub-Nyquist sampling techniques have emerged as powerful tools to overcome the limitations of traditional Nyquist sampling, allowing for the acquisition of signals at rates below what was previously thought possible. These methods leverage known signal structure and sparsity to reduce sampling rates while still enabling accurate signal reconstruction  (5, Mishali et al., 2011)  (56, Eldar et al., 2011).\n\nOne notable approach is the modulated wideband converter (MWC), which multiplies the analog signal with a bank of periodic waveforms, followed by low-pass filtering and uniform sampling at a rate significantly lower than Nyquist  (2, Eldar et al., 2009). This technique has been successfully applied to spectrum-sparse signals, demonstrating effective sub-Nyquist sampling and perfect reconstruction  (6, Gai et al., 2011).\n\nCompressive sensing (CS) has emerged as a prominent framework for sub-Nyquist sampling of sparse signals  (14, Hu et al., 2017). CS-based approaches, such as the analog-to-information converter (AIC), use random demodulation techniques to achieve sub-Nyquist sampling of wideband signals  (234, Zhang et al., 2023). These methods have found particular application in wideband spectrum sensing, where the inherent sparsity of spectrum utilization can be exploited  (77, Chen et al., 2013).\n\nOther sub-Nyquist sampling strategies include multicoset sampling, coprime sampling, and generalized sampling  (8, Cohen et al., 2013)  (236, Govindarajan et al., 2023)  (232, Manganaro et al., 2023). These techniques often rely on multiple parallel sampling channels or specific sampling patterns to capture the signal information at sub-Nyquist rates.\n\nThe Xampling framework has been proposed as a comprehensive approach to sub-Nyquist sampling, aiming to satisfy key principles such as capturing a broad set of analog inputs, low sampling rates, efficient implementation, and the ability to process any information band of interest at a low rate  (41, Shoshan et al., 2009).\n\nRecent advancements have further extended sub-Nyquist sampling capabilities. For instance, super-Nyquist co-prime sampling schemes have been developed to reconstruct second-order statistics at twice the Nyquist rate using sub-Nyquist samplers  (20, Dias, 2020). Additionally, techniques for estimating frequencies of multiple sinusoids from sub-Nyquist sampling sequences have been explored  (13, Sun et al., 2016).\n\nThe development of sub-Nyquist sampling techniques has significant implications for various applications, particularly in the realm of analog-to-digital conversion and wideband signal processing. These methods enable the use of lower-speed analog-to-digital converters for high-speed sampling  (224, Li et al., 2023), potentially leading to more efficient and cost-effective hardware solutions  (56, Eldar et al., 2011).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These methods exploit signal sparsity and structure to reconstruct high-frequency components from low-rate samples.\n\nSub-Nyquist sampling techniques have revolutionized signal acquisition by allowing the extraction of frequency domain information beyond the traditional Nyquist limit. These methods exploit signal sparsity and structure in the frequency domain to reconstruct high-frequency components from low-rate samples  (19, Mamistvalov et al., 2020) (21, L\u00f3pez et al., 2022). By leveraging compressed sensing (CS) and other advanced sampling frameworks, it is possible to acquire and process wideband signals at rates significantly below the Nyquist rate without losing critical information  (1, Strauss et al., 2006)  (16, Eldar et al., 2018).\n\nOne key approach is the use of random nonuniform sampling, which provides both undersampling and anti-aliasing benefits, allowing the recovery of frequency components that exceed the sampling density (21, L\u00f3pez et al., 2022). This technique has been successfully applied in various domains, including radar systems, where sub-Nyquist sampling in both space and time maintains high resolution despite reduced sampling rates  (12, Mishra et al., 2016).\n\nThe Xampling framework and other analog-to-information conversion (AIC) systems have emerged as powerful tools for sub-Nyquist sampling of wideband signals  (15, Cohen et al., 2018). These approaches model the received signal as having a finite rate of innovation, enabling efficient sampling and reconstruction of sparse signals  (16, Eldar et al., 2018). In radar applications, techniques like Doppler focusing allow for low-rate sampling and digital processing while maintaining the ability to extract high-frequency information (7, Bar-Ilan et al., 2012).\n\nMulti-rate asynchronous sub-Nyquist sampling (MASS) has been proposed for wideband spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks, offering lower sampling rates compared to previous approaches  (65, Sun et al., 2012). This method, along with other sub-Nyquist techniques, enables the processing of signals that extend beyond the Nyquist frequency, addressing practical needs in various applications  (22, Yamamoto et al., 2022).\n\nRecent advancements have further expanded the capabilities of sub-Nyquist sampling. For instance, methods have been developed to deal with disjoint fractional frequency bands of signals in the fractional Fourier domain  (229, Li et al., 2023). Additionally, hardware implementations, such as direct IF sampling receivers for mm-wave applications, have made sub-Nyquist techniques more accessible and practical  (235, Ford et al., 2023).\n\nThe impact of these sub-Nyquist sampling techniques extends beyond signal acquisition. They have enabled the development of efficient wideband spectrum sensing solutions  (152, Guizani et al., 2018) and real-time sub-Nyquist systems for millimeter wave applications  (168, Song et al., 2019). These advancements demonstrate that it is indeed possible to obtain frequency domain information in bands beyond the limitations of traditional Nyquist theory, opening up new possibilities in signal processing and communication systems.\n\nReferences:\n1.

A real-time sub-Nyquist wideband spectrum sensing system for millimeter wave (mmWave) implemented on National Instruments mmWave software-defined radio system is presented.\n\n\n\nApplications and Benefits of Sub-Nyquist Sampling\nTLDR: Sub-Nyquist sampling techniques offer significant advantages in various applications, particularly in medical imaging and wireless communications. These methods enable reduced data acquisition, faster processing, and improved spectral efficiency while maintaining signal quality.\n\n- Medical Imaging: Sub-Nyquist sampling has been successfully applied to ultrasound imaging. By using frequency domain beamforming and compressed beamforming techniques, researchers have demonstrated that high-quality images can be reconstructed from far fewer samples than traditional methods require  (78, Chernyakova et al., 2013). This approach allows for faster image acquisition and processing, potentially improving real-time imaging capabilities in medical diagnostics.\n\n- Wireless Communications: In the field of cognitive radio and spectrum sensing, sub-Nyquist sampling techniques have enabled more efficient power spectrum estimation. The modulated wideband converter (MWC) approach allows for compressed sampling of wideband signals, facilitating spectrum analysis at rates below the Nyquist rate  (167, Yang et al., 2019). This can lead to improved spectral efficiency and more effective use of available bandwidth in wireless communication systems.\n\n- Radar Systems: Sub-Nyquist sampling has been applied to radar signal processing, particularly in time-domain and frequency-domain beamforming. This approach allows for a significant reduction in the number of samples required to form high-quality radar images, potentially leading to more efficient and cost-effective radar systems  (10, Burshtein et al., 2015).\n\n- Signal Processing Efficiency: By exploiting signal sparsity in the frequency domain, sub-Nyquist sampling can dramatically reduce the amount of data that needs to be acquired and processed. This can lead to significant improvements in processing speed and efficiency, particularly for signals with sparse frequency content  (30, Venkataramani et al., 2001).\n\n- Hardware Simplification: The reduced sampling rates afforded by sub-Nyquist techniques can potentially allow for the use of lower-speed, less expensive analog-to-digital converters in various applications. This could lead to more cost-effective and energy-efficient hardware implementations (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nIt's important to note that while sub-Nyquist sampling offers many benefits, it may also introduce increased error sensitivity, particularly for signals with non-tiling frequency support  (30, Venkataramani et al., 2001). Therefore, careful consideration of signal characteristics and application requirements is necessary when implementing these techniques.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These tools provide valuable insights into model decision-making processes, although they come with their own limitations and complexities.\n\nThe integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, particularly SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), has substantially improved the interpretability of complex machine learning models across various domains  (20, Wallach et al., 2020). These techniques offer post-hoc explanations for model predictions, addressing the critical need for transparency in high-stakes applications such as healthcare and criminal justice.\n\nSHAP and LIME have demonstrated their effectiveness in identifying key features and regions in input data that contribute most significantly to model predictions  (4, Jhanjhi et al., 2023). This capability provides valuable insights into the decision-making process of deep learning models, making them more accessible to human understanding. Studies have shown that explanations generated by these XAI tools greatly assist lay individuals in comprehending machine learning model predictions, potentially increasing trust in the model's output  (2, Cavdar et al., 2021).\n\nThe application of SHAP and LIME extends across various machine learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other complex models  (64, Saluja et al., 2021).

Their model-agnostic nature allows for broad applicability, making them versatile tools for enhancing model interpretability  (199, Leivo et al., 2023).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while SHAP and LIME significantly improve model interpretability, they are not without limitations. These XAI methods can sometimes suffer from their own complexity, potentially limiting their usefulness in certain scenarios (5, Raisi-Estabragh et al., 2023). Additionally, in some cases, explanations provided by LIME and SHAP might marginally impact user performance negatively, although the effect is generally not substantial  (21, Ras et al., 2020).\n\nDespite these challenges, the consensus among researchers is that SHAP and LIME are invaluable tools for analyzing trained models and understanding their predictions  (152, Sathyan et al., 2022). They contribute significantly to making AI systems more transparent and interpretable, providing human-interpretable evidence and reasoning behind model decisions  (223, Nambiar et al., 2023). This increased interpretability is crucial for building trust in AI systems and facilitating their responsible deployment in critical applications.\n\nIn conclusion, while SHAP and LIME have dramatically improved model interpretability, ongoing research and usability studies are necessary to further enhance their effectiveness and user experience  (26, Kirrane et al., 2020).

[(26, Kirrane et al., 2020) | n_citations: 65 | Why model why? Assessing the strengths and limitations of LIME ]: \nWhen it comes to xAI frameworks, the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) framework is one of the predominant tools discussed in the literature... In order to better understand the behaviour of our four classification models we employ the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) xAI framework... Overall, we conclude that while LIME helps to increase model interpretability, usability studies are needed in order to improve the user experience\n\n\n\nComparison of SHAP and LIME\nTLDR: SHAP and LIME are both popular XAI techniques, but they differ in performance and applicability. While SHAP generally outperforms LIME in terms of accuracy and consistency, LIME may be more suitable for specific scenarios, particularly with dense datasets.\n\nSHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) are two widely used XAI techniques that provide local explanations for complex machine learning models  (19, Das et al., 2020). Both methods aim to enhance model interpretability, but they differ in their approaches and performance across various scenarios.\n\nSeveral studies have compared SHAP and LIME, revealing that SHAP often outperforms LIME in terms of accuracy and consistency. For instance, Abdallah et al. found that SHAP provided better performance across six evaluation metrics compared to LIME  (311, Abdallah et al., 2024). Similarly, Yalcin et al. reported that SHAP consistently performed better than LIME, with a 26% higher average performance  (85, Yalcin et al., 2021).\n\nSHAP's superiority is often attributed to its more precise interpretation mechanism and its ability to provide both local and global explanations  (132, Martino et al., 2022). This versatility makes SHAP a preferred choice in many applications, including healthcare and finance  (81, Vivek et al., 2021).\n\nHowever, LIME may have advantages in specific scenarios. Roberts et al. discovered that LIME performs better than SHAP in dense segments of datasets, while SHAP excels in sparse segments  (174, Roberts et al., 2022). This difference is attributed to the varying bias-variance characteristics of the underlying estimators used by LIME and SHAP.\n\nIn terms of user comprehension, results are mixed. Jalali et al. found that users demonstrated higher predictability with LIME explanations compared to SHAP  (6, Jalali et al., 2023). Conversely, Honegger argued that SHAP explanations are more interpretable and accurate than those of LIME  (1, Honegger, 2018).\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on the context, underlying model, and data complexity  (98, Moreira et al., 2021). For example, Kumar et al. observed that while SHAP generally performed better, LIME outperformed SHAP for certain models and datasets  (233, Kumar et al., 2023).\n\nBoth SHAP and LIME have been successfully implemented in various domains, enhancing model interpretability  (312, Gaspar et al., 2024). However, researchers emphasize the need for careful consideration when choosing between these methods, as their performance can be context-dependent  (246, Soldatos et al., 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, while SHAP generally demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy and consistency, LIME remains a valuable tool, particularly for dense datasets and specific use cases. The choice between SHAP and LIME should be based on the specific requirements of the project, the nature of the data, and the underlying model complexity.\n\nReferences:\n1.

However, we notice that for the LR model, SHAP does not perform well compared to LIME for the RUL explanation across the sub-datasets.\n\n11.

In summary, the results reveal that SHAP outperforms LIME in terms of fidelity, while both methods have similar simplicity scores... However, LIME demonstrates higher stability compared to SHAP.\n\n\n\nLimitations and Challenges\nTLDR: While SHAP and LIME significantly enhance model interpretability, they face several limitations including potential inaccuracies, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and challenges in interpreting complex outputs. These issues highlight the need for continued research and careful application of XAI techniques.\n\nDespite the significant advancements in model interpretability offered by SHAP and LIME, these XAI techniques come with their own set of limitations and challenges. One primary concern is the potential inaccuracy of explanations provided by these methods. Post-hoc interpretation techniques that develop mirror models of the original complex model may provide inaccurate representations, potentially misleading users about the true decision-making process  (60, Antoniadi et al., 2021).\n\nA critical vulnerability of both SHAP and LIME lies in their dependence on input perturbation. This approach makes it possible to create adversarial models that appear ethical when explained using perturbed inputs but may behave unethically when evaluated without perturbation  (61, Madsen et al., 2021). This limitation raises concerns about the reliability of these explanations in high-stakes applications where model behavior must be consistently ethical and transparent.\n\nFurthermore, the explanations generated by SHAP and LIME often suffer from their own complexity, potentially limiting their usefulness in certain scenarios (5, Raisi-Estabragh et al., 2023). The irony is that while these methods aim to unveil the complexity of black-box models, they themselves may produce outputs that are difficult for users to interpret, especially in complex domains.\n\nAnother limitation is that SHAP and LIME results may only identify part of the discriminative features and sometimes attribute importance to non-relevant parts of the input data  (34, Masson et al., 2020). This partial identification can lead to incomplete or potentially misleading interpretations of model behavior, particularly in time series analysis or other complex data structures.\n\nThe feature attribution approach used by LIME and SHAP has also been criticized for revealing little about how an AI model actually works  (196, Longo et al., 2023). This limitation has led to the development of concept-based XAI methods that aim to express human-understandable concepts as part of the explanation, potentially offering more intuitive insights into model decision-making.\n\nLastly, the explanations generated by LIME and SHAP often leave significant room for user interpretation, requiring individuals to infer why certain regions of the input were considered important  (271, Gasparetto et al., 2023). This ambiguity can lead to inconsistent or subjective interpretations of model behavior, potentially undermining the goal of enhancing model transparency and trust.\n\nThese limitations underscore the need for continued research in XAI techniques and careful consideration when applying SHAP, LIME, or other interpretability methods to complex machine learning models. As the field evolves, addressing these challenges will be crucial for developing more robust, reliable, and truly interpretable AI systems.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These systems use techniques like fuzzy logic, neural networks, and adaptive algorithms to handle uncertainties and disturbances.\n\nDeveloping robust control systems is crucial for enhancing the performance and safety of quadrotor UAVs in challenging environments. Several advanced techniques have been proposed to address this need. Fuzzy logic-based approaches, such as the robust fuzzy backstepping sliding mode controller (RFBSMC), have shown high performance in terms of stability, trajectory tracking, and robustness against external disturbances and parameter uncertainties  (7, Khebbache et al., 2013). Similarly, fuzzy PID control methods based on ant colony algorithms have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing the influence of perturbations and stabilizing motion patterns under wind disturbance conditions  (80, Tang, 2024).\n\nNeural network-based solutions have also proven valuable. The integration of deep neural networks (DNNs) with robust linear quadratic regulators (RLQR) has improved flight performance during trajectory tracking, particularly when subjected to wind gusts  (83, Benevides et al., 2024). Additionally, the combination of neural networks with interval type-2 fuzzy logic control and sliding mode control (NNIT2FSMC) has shown promise in alleviating chattering effects and maintaining robustness against external disturbances  (15, Bouguerra et al., 2017).\n\nAdaptive control strategies have been developed to handle uncertainties and disturbances in real-time. For instance, an adaptive dynamic surface trajectory tracking control method based on the Nussbaum function has been proposed to address unknown external disturbances and unidentified nonlinearities  (82, Zhu et al., 2024). Self-regulating fuzzy PID control systems have also demonstrated improved disturbance rejection capabilities  (49, Abdelmaksoud et al., 2021).\n\nTo enhance the estimation and compensation of disturbances, several approaches have been explored. The use of extended state observers (ESO) has been shown to improve the robustness of flight control systems by canceling out uncertainties such as unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances  (3, Fan et al., 2010). Gaussian process learning methods have been employed to estimate the upper bound of model errors caused by parameter uncertainty and wind disturbance, enabling more accurate trajectory tracking  (59, Yang et al., 2022).\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence techniques with disturbance observer-based feedback linearization has proven effective in improving disturbance approximation and compensation, resulting in more robust flight control under various conditions  (19, Lazim et al., 2018). Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) strategies, particularly when combined with fuzzy logic, have shown stronger stability and robustness compared to classical ADRC and PID control methods  (74, Liu et al., 2023).\n\nIn summary, the development of robust control systems for quadrotor UAVs involves a diverse range of advanced techniques, including fuzzy logic, neural networks, adaptive algorithms, and disturbance estimation methods. These approaches aim to enhance the UAV's ability to maintain stability, track trajectories accurately, and reject disturbances in challenging environmental conditions, ultimately improving their robustness and safety in extreme weather scenarios.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These adaptations include hardware modifications, operational strategies, and consideration of weather impacts on different UAV sizes.\n\n\u2022 Avionics isolation: To protect sensitive electronic components from extreme weather conditions, UAVs can be customized by isolating the avionics (16, Al-Fuqaha et al., 2018).\n\n\u2022 Engine modifications: Using a fuel-injection engine instead of a carburetor can help avoid icing issues in cold weather conditions (16, Al-Fuqaha et al., 2018).\n\n\u2022 Ice prevention: Implementing a servo-system to force ice breaking over the leading edge of the airfoil can help maintain aerodynamic performance in icy conditions (16, Al-Fuqaha et al., 2018).\n\n\u2022 Proper insulation: UAVs should be equipped with adequate insulation to protect against adverse precipitation and extreme temperatures  (55, Panagiotakopoulos et al., 2022).\n\n\u2022 Weather avoidance: When possible, UAVs should avoid flying in extreme weather conditions altogether  (55, Panagiotakopoulos et al., 2022).\n\n\u2022 Size considerations: Small and medium-sized UAVs are particularly vulnerable to weather impacts due to their low-altitude flight patterns  (72, Lipsett et al., 2023).\n\n\u2022 Ice navigation strategies: Given the smaller size of most UAVs, it is crucial to develop specific strategies for navigating around icy weather conditions  (73, Ford et al., 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(16, Al-Fuqaha et al., 2018) | n_citations: 1238 | Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: A Survey on Civil Applications and Key Research Challenges ]: \nThe steps to customize the UAV for the extreme weather conditions were: 1) The avionics were isolated; 2) A fuel-injection engine was used to avoid carburetor icing; 3) A servo-system was adopted to force ice breaking over the leading edge of the air-foil.\n\n2.

[(73, Ford et al., 2023) | n_citations: 1 | Hybrid A* path search with resource constraints and dynamic obstacles ]: \nSince UAVs are generally smaller, it is important to develop strategies for navigating around ice weather conditions.\n\n\n\nWind Disturbance Mitigation\nTLDR: Wind disturbance mitigation is crucial for quadrotor UAV performance in extreme conditions. Strategies include advanced control systems, real-time adaptation, and innovative trajectory planning techniques.\n\nWind disturbances pose significant challenges to quadrotor UAV operations, particularly in outdoor environments and extreme weather conditions  (18, Lee et al., 2018) (42, Li et al., 2021). To address this issue, researchers have developed various strategies to enhance the robustness and safety of quadrotors in windy conditions.\n\nOne approach involves incorporating wind characteristics into control systems. For instance, some controllers explicitly account for turbulent conditions during landing operations, enabling fast and direct trajectories without the need for hovering over platforms  (22, Lopez et al., 2019). Advanced control techniques, such as Barrier Certificate-Based Control Barriers (BCBFs), have been demonstrated to improve quadrotor performance when exposed to external disturbances and varying sensing conditions  (66, Pek et al., 2023).\n\nReal-time adaptation and learning-based approaches have shown promise in mitigating wind disturbances. Neural-Fly, a learning-based method, allows for rapid online adaptation by incorporating pre-trained representations through deep learning, achieving precise flight control with smaller tracking errors compared to traditional nonlinear and adaptive controllers  (78, Chung et al., 2023). Similarly, reinforcement learning-based controllers have been developed to handle scenarios where quadcopters lose one or multiple propellers mid-flight, enhancing their ability to operate in harsh weather conditions  (31, Ghose et al., 2020).\n\nInnovative trajectory planning and tracking methods have been proposed to navigate unknown environments with unpredictable aerodynamic effects. The Kinodynamic Jump Space Search (Kino-JSS) generates safe and efficient routes in environments with aerodynamic disturbances, allowing quadrotors to deviate from predetermined plans when encountering strong winds  (53, Qian et al., 2022). Time-dependent control strategies have also been developed to improve quadrotor maneuverability and robustness against wind gusts  (56, Najafinia et al., 2022).\n\nAdvancements in sensing technology play a crucial role in wind disturbance mitigation. The use of remote wind measurements from LiDAR systems has enabled the development of wind-preview-based Model Predictive Controllers (MPC) for improved disturbance rejection  (67, Whidborne et al., 2023). Additionally, progress in airflow sensing technology is expected to significantly enhance multirotor drone performance in severe wind conditions  (54, Majumdar et al., 2022).\n\nMachine learning techniques have been integrated with control systems to estimate and compensate for wind-induced uncertainties. Gaussian Processes (GPs) have been used to estimate uncertainties caused by wind disturbances, while control barrier functions (CBFs) ensure safety constraints during trajectory tracking  (34, Zheng et al., 2020). These approaches enable quadrotor UAVs to track desired trajectories even in the presence of unknown weather disturbances  (24, Diem et al., 2019).\n\nResearchers have also focused on optimizing real UAVs with actual payloads in strong, realistic wind disturbances, bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical applications  (25, Howard et al., 2019). This approach ensures that the developed strategies are effective in real-world scenarios, further enhancing the robustness and safety of quadrotor UAVs in extreme weather conditions.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These include autonomous landing site detection, dynamic flight path adjustments, and multi-level adaptation strategies.\n\nEnsuring the safety of quadrotor UAVs in extreme weather conditions requires robust emergency landing and safety measures. One crucial aspect is the ability to autonomously detect suitable landing sites. UAVs should be equipped with sensors and algorithms that can analyze terrain information and other environmental data to identify safe landing locations in case of emergencies or normal operations  (36, Tefas et al., 2021).\n\nTo address the risks posed by severe convective weather, dynamic flight path adjustment algorithms have been developed. For instance, the virtual potential force algorithm can be used to modify the UAV's flight direction in real-time when encountering sudden dangerous weather conditions, thereby ensuring flight safety  (44, Chang et al., 2021).\n\nFormal verification methods have been applied to UAV control systems to enhance safety. By utilizing higher-order logic interactive theorem-provers and automated theorem-provers, researchers have formally verified nonlinear attitude control systems for multi-rotor UAVs. This approach allows for the detection of potential stability issues, which can be used to advise remote pilots or onboard intelligent agents to alter flight paths or initiate emergency landings  (35, Jasim et al., 2020)  (58, Jasim et al., 2022).\n\nIn scenarios involving engine failures during turbulent weather, a multi-level adaptation approach has been proposed. This framework incorporates mission planning, path tracking, and stabilizing control to evaluate potential emergency landing sites efficiently, navigate online, and follow optimal paths for automatic landing  (60, Gu et al., 2022).\n\nReal-time route planning strategies have also been developed to address abrupt changes in flying conditions, including adverse weather, terrain threats, and unexpected obstacles. These methods can quickly generate viable, safe, and optimal routes for UAVs, enhancing their ability to adapt to changing environments and maintain safety  (4, Zhou et al., 2011).\n\nBy implementing these emergency landing and safety measures, quadrotor UAVs can significantly improve their robustness and safety when operating in extreme weather conditions. These strategies complement the advanced control systems and wind disturbance mitigation techniques discussed earlier, providing a comprehensive approach to enhancing UAV performance and safety in challenging environments.\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "e03c49cccc971cf3ae67556554b4666b", "answer_text": "Clarification and Intent Understanding Techniques\nTLDR: Various approaches have been developed to enable LLMs to clarify user intent through targeted questions and multi-turn interactions. These techniques aim to improve the accuracy and relevance of LLM responses by addressing ambiguity and gathering additional information.\n\nRecent research has focused on developing frameworks and techniques that allow Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in more dynamic and interactive dialogues with users, particularly for clarifying intent and understanding complex queries. Several approaches have been proposed to address this challenge.\n\nOne notable technique is the use of targeted clarifying questions. ClarifyGPT, for instance, is a framework that enables LLMs to identify ambiguous requirements in code generation tasks and formulate specific questions to address these ambiguities  (5, Wang et al., 2023). Similarly, CLAM allows language models to detect question ambiguity, generate appropriate clarifying questions, and provide final answers after receiving clarification  (2, Kuhn et al., 2022).\n\nMulti-stage clarification mechanisms have also been explored. Lautraite et al. propose a system for prompting clarification and query selection in question-answering dialogues  (1, Lautraite et al., 2021). The EDIT framework generates open questions related to dialogue context, answers those questions by interacting with LLMs and domain-specific knowledge bases, and then enhances response generation by integrating this additional knowledge  (7, Wu et al., 2023).\n\nSome approaches focus on decomposing complex problems. Hauer et al. suggest using an orchestrating LLM to interact with users and break down vague problems into more manageable components  (9, Hauer et al., 2024). This method allows the LLM to ask follow-up questions and gain a deeper understanding of user requirements.\n\nOther techniques involve rephrasing or expanding user queries. The 'Rephrase and Respond' (RaR) method allows LLMs to rephrase and expand questions posed by humans before providing responses  (3, Chen et al., 2023). This approach can help address potential misunderstandings between humans and LLMs.\n\nActive learning techniques have also been applied to this problem. LaMAI (Language Model with Active Inquiry) uses such techniques to select the most informative questions for users, fostering dynamic bidirectional dialogue  (8, Tang et al., 2024). Similarly, Liu et al. propose an uncertainty-aware simulation approach that enables models to simulate possible future scenarios and select optimal questions based on expected rewards  (134, Liu et al., 2024).\n\nSome researchers have explored frameworks that break down the clarification process into subtasks. Choi et al. propose a task-agnostic framework that determines when clarification is needed, what clarifying question to ask, and how to respond accurately with the new information  (6, Choi et al., 2023).\n\nOther techniques focus on analyzing user queries more comprehensively. Zhao et al. instruct LLMs to analyze questions by identifying possible user roles, understanding explicit and implicit demands, and determining what types of evidence are needed to answer the question  (136, Zhao et al., 2024). Kasneci et al. explore whether reformulating user prompts to better reflect intended queries can enhance LLM response quality  (135, Kasneci et al., 2024).\n\nIt's worth noting that there are challenges in developing and evaluating these techniques. Soulier et al. highlight the scarcity of datasets providing labeled ambiguous questions along with supporting documents and relevant clarifying questions  (140, Soulier et al., 2024). This underscores the need for more comprehensive resources to advance research in this area.\n\nIn summary, a wide range of techniques have been developed to enable LLMs to engage in more effective clarification dialogues with users. These approaches span from targeted question generation to multi-stage clarification mechanisms and active learning techniques, all aimed at improving the accuracy and relevance of LLM responses in complex query scenarios.\n\nReferences:\n1.

We design the prompt to enable LLM to simulate multiple different sets of future interactions between questioner and answerer, then let LLM choose one most promising interaction (question) to ask.\n\n9. [(6, Choi et al., 2023) | n_citations: 6 | Clarify When Necessary: Resolving Ambiguity Through Interaction with LMs ]: \nWe study such behavior in LMs by proposing a task-agnostic framework for resolving ambiguity by asking users clarifying questions.

[(136, Zhao et al., 2024) | n_citations: 1 | Chain-of-Discussion: A Multi-Model Framework for Complex Evidence-Based Question Answering ]: \nWe initially prompt LLMs to analyze the question q, including identifying the possible role of users, understanding explicit and implicit demands of users, and determining what types of evidence is needed to answer the question... We first instruct the LLMs to analyze the question, including facts mentions in q, primary needs of the user, and potential scenarios associated with the question.\n\n11. [(135, Kasneci et al., 2024) | n_citations: 3 | User Intent Recognition and Satisfaction with Large Language Models: A User Study with ChatGPT ]: \nHere, we explore whether accurately recognizing and then reformulating a user's prompt to better mirror their intended query leads to an enhancement in the quality of the LLM's responses... Such comprehensive coverage is critical to accurately identify the intent behind user queries and enable LLMs to provide relevant and targeted responses.\n\n12. [(140, Soulier et al., 2024) | n_citations: 0 | PAQA: Toward ProActive Open-Retrieval Question Answering ]: \nOne major limitation is the scarcity of datasets that provide labelled ambiguous questions along with a supporting corpus of documents and relevant clarifying questions... We then evaluate various models and assess how passage retrieval impacts ambiguity detection and the generation of clarifying questions.\n\n\n\nMulti-turn Interaction Frameworks\nTLDR: Multi-turn interaction frameworks enable more dynamic and context-aware dialogues between users and LLMs. These frameworks employ various strategies such as question decomposition, graphical interfaces, and adaptive prompting to enhance the quality and relevance of LLM responses.\n\nRecent research has focused on developing frameworks that facilitate more sophisticated multi-turn interactions between users and Large Language Models (LLMs). These approaches aim to improve the clarity, accuracy, and relevance of LLM responses by enabling more dynamic and context-aware dialogues.\n\nOne notable strategy is the decomposition of complex queries into smaller, more manageable steps. The Flipped Interaction pattern, for instance, instructs LLMs to automatically suggest a series of subquestions for users to answer, before combining these responses to address the overall query (44, Spencer-Smith et al., 2023). Similarly, Im et al. propose a mixed-initiative interaction approach that decomposes prompts into smaller steps through Question-Answer (QA) interactions, allowing users to refine prompts by responding to clarifying questions generated by the LLM  (107, Im et al., 2023).\n\nSeveral frameworks focus on reformatting tasks and prompts to enhance LLM performance. The AMA framework recursively uses LLMs to reformat tasks and prompts into more effective formats, employing a structure of forming questions based on the input and then prompting the LLM to answer these questions  (33, Orr et al., 2022). This approach has shown improvements across diverse benchmark tasks.\n\nSome researchers have explored the use of graphical interfaces to enhance multi-turn interactions. Graphologue, for example, employs novel prompting strategies and interface designs to extract entities and relationships from LLM responses and construct node-link diagrams in real-time, enabling graphical, non-linear dialogues between humans and LLMs  (61, Jiang et al., 2023).\n\nAdaptive prompting strategies have also gained attention. Song et al. highlight ongoing efforts to develop adaptive strategies that enhance LLMs' ability for task planning and tool utilization  (123, Song et al., 2023). The Prompt Middleware framework, presented by MacNeil et al., generates prompts for LLMs based on UI affordances, including static prompts predefined by experts, template-based prompts with fill-in options, and free-form prompts  (86, MacNeil et al., 2023).\n\nTo address incomplete information in user queries, Jin et al. propose leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to identify key parameters and use a question-and-answer format in natural conversations to solicit this information from users  (116, Jin et al., 2023). This approach allows users to engage with LLMs through natural language queries and responses.\n\nSome frameworks focus on improving question answering by utilizing similar questions. Liu et al. propose scenarios where LLMs try to answer user queries with the help of a collected question database, inspired by federated learning techniques  (78, Liu et al., 2023).\n\nEfforts have also been made to simplify the process of generating follow-up and clarification questions. The Qlarify system, for instance, provides users with a set of common questions to select from, obviating the need for crafting complex prompts  (117, Chang et al., 2023).\n\nIt's worth noting that the development of these multi-turn interaction frameworks often involves creating new datasets and benchmarking tools. Aliannejadi et al., for example, collected and released a new dataset focused on open-domain single- and multi-turn conversations, while also proposing a pipeline for evaluating the quality of clarifying questions in various dialogues  (26, Aliannejadi et al., 2021).\n\nIn summary, multi-turn interaction frameworks employ a diverse range of strategies to enhance dialogues between users and LLMs. These approaches, ranging from query decomposition to graphical interfaces and adaptive prompting, aim to improve the clarity, accuracy, and relevance of LLM responses in complex interaction scenarios.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(44, Spencer-Smith et al., 2023) | n_citations: 554 | A Prompt Pattern Catalog to Enhance Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT ]: \nThe Flipped Interaction pattern instructs the LLM to automatically suggest a series of subquestions for the user to answer before combining the answers to the subquestions and producing an answer to the overall question... The LLM can often better select the format, number, and content of the interactions to ensure that the goal is reached faster, more accurately, and/or by using knowledge the user may not (initially) possess.\n\n2. [(107, Im et al., 2023) | n_citations: 3 | PromptCrafter: Crafting Text-to-Image Prompt through Mixed-Initiative Dialogue with LLM ]: \nIn this paper, we propose a novel mixed-initiative interaction approach with Large Language Model (LLM), in which we decompose a prompt into smaller steps through Question-Answer (QA)...

We find that using an open-ended prompt that asks the LM to generate relevant context, and then prompting the model to answer the original question using the generated context is effective.\n\n4.

These approaches aim to improve LLM comprehension, reasoning, and response quality for complex queries.\n\n1. Reformulation and Task-Specific Formats: Researchers have explored reformulating QA tasks as text generation problems, using appropriate prompts from context and questions  (25, Jiang et al., 2021). This approach allows different QA formats to be solved within the same framework, enhancing versatility.\n\n2. Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA): Takayama et al. propose a method where LLMs generate diverse candidate plans labeled A-E, including an \"option not listed\" choice. This MCQA setup uses few-shot exemplars to prompt LLMs to generate semantically different options  (47, Takayama et al., 2023).\n\n3. Software Engineering Prompt Patterns: White et al. present prompt design techniques for software engineering tasks, addressing common problems when using LLMs like ChatGPT  (48, White et al., 2023).\n\n4. Chain-of-Thought Prompting: This method guides LLMs to generate intermediate reasoning explanations before providing answers. By using prompts in the format of \"question, rationale, answer,\" LLMs learn to reason in steps  (49, Zhao et al., 2023).\n\n5. Active-Prompt: This technique adapts LLMs to different tasks using task-specific example prompts. It borrows ideas from uncertainty-based active learning to select the most uncertain questions for annotation  (50, Diao et al., 2023).\n\n6. User Accommodation Strategies: Research has shown that users adapt their prompting strategies based on the LLM's capabilities. For example, users working with certain models may switch to declarative, \"fill-in-the-blank\" style prompts for better results  (34, Rong et al., 2022).\n\n7. Rephrase and Respond (RaR): This method allows LLMs to rephrase and expand questions in a single prompt, improving comprehension and response accuracy  (130, Saha et al., 2024).\n\n8. Socratic Prompting: This technique emulates the Socratic method of dialogue, using a series of questions to lead the model or user to a conclusion. It allows for exploring the depth of an LLM's knowledge on specific topics  (138, Fagbohun et al., 2024).\n\n9. Keyword Extraction and Dialogue Construction: This approach involves extracting task-relevant keywords from questions and using them to construct brief dialogues in a zero-shot manner  (139, Wang et al., 2024).\n\n10. Automated Rationale Explanation: This pattern asks LLMs to explain the rationale behind given answers automatically, enhancing user understanding  (84, White et al., 2023).\n\n11. Iterative Prompt Refinement: Users can adapt their prompts based on the LLM's previous responses, adding details or context that were initially lacking. This iterative process allows for more productive dialogues  (95, Tang et al., 2023).\n\n12. Specialized Interface Tools: These tools can scaffold human-LLM interactions by providing structured prompts or templates to guide users in clarifying their intentions  (80, SUBRAMONYAM, 2023).\n\n13. Advanced Reasoning Techniques: Researchers have explored various prompt design techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Reasoning and Acting (ReAct), and others to improve LLMs' reasoning and acting capabilities in QA tasks  (64, Santu et al., 2023).\n\n14. Context and Knowledge Enhancement: Adding additional context, knowledge, constraints, instructions, and examples to prompts can improve answer success probability  (81, Daull et al., 2023).\n\n15. Automatic Clarification Question Generation: Recent studies have introduced LLM-based methods to generate clarifying questions for ambiguous queries automatically  (85, Kang et al., 2023).\n\n16. Task-Specific Question Generation: This technique uses an LLM to generate task-specific questions for users to answer, providing better context for downstream tasks  (69, Arunkumar et al., 2023).\n\n17. Personalized Prompting: Some approaches focus on designing comprehensive prompts that enable LLMs to generate contextually relevant responses aligned with user-specific dialogue preferences  (92, Zhang et al., 2023).\n\n18. Approach Generation: This method involves creating instruction prompts that ask LLMs to generate multiple approaches to solve a given question, conforming to a specified template  (96, Naik et al., 2023).\n\n19. Linguistic Cue-based Chain-of-Thoughts: This novel approach enhances LLM inference by incorporating an intermediate reasoning step to find cues exhibited in the dialogue context  (70, Wang et al., 2023).\n\n20.

It offers potential insights into individual differences in motives and the interplay between implicit and explicit motivations.\n\nThe field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has drawn from various psychological theories to inform its research and design practices. However, some potentially valuable theories remain underexplored. One such theory that has received little attention in HCI studies is Motive Disposition Theory (MDT)  (5, Yu, 2023). MDT is a prominent motivation theory that focuses on human needs and offers several unique perspectives that could enrich HCI research.\n\nMDT distinguishes itself by emphasizing individual differences in motives, which could provide valuable insights for designing more personalized and effective user interfaces. Additionally, the theory makes an important distinction between implicit and explicit motives, suggesting that people's conscious goals may not always align with their underlying motivational tendencies  (5, Yu, 2023). This nuanced understanding of motivation could help HCI researchers better predict and explain user behavior in various contexts.\n\nAnother aspect of MDT that sets it apart is its consideration of fear motives alongside approach motives  (5, Yu, 2023). This inclusion of avoidance-based motivations could be particularly relevant for understanding user interactions with new technologies or potentially risky online behaviors.\n\nWhile the application of MDT in HCI is currently limited, its focus on individual differences, implicit-explicit motive distinctions, and fear motives presents an opportunity for researchers to explore new dimensions of user motivation and behavior in digital environments (LLM MEMORY, 2024). Incorporating MDT into HCI studies could lead to more nuanced user models and potentially more effective interaction designs that account for a wider range of motivational factors.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(5, Yu, 2023) | n_citations: 0 | Another Recipe App: A Design Case with Motive Disposition Theory ]: \nMotive disposition theory (MDT) is another prominent motivation theory that addresses human needs. However, the application of MDT is barely seen in HCI studies. MDT emphasizes individual differences in motives, differentiates implicit and explicit motives, and takes fear motives into account.\n\n\n\nPotential for MTurk Testing\nTLDR: MTurk offers a viable platform for testing psychological theories in HCI contexts due to its large, diverse participant pool and cost-effectiveness. However, researchers must carefully consider potential limitations such as sample biases and data quality issues.\n\n(LLM MEMORY, 2024) Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) presents a promising avenue for testing psychological theories in the context of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. The platform's large and diverse participant pool, coupled with its cost-effectiveness and rapid data collection capabilities, makes it an attractive option for researchers looking to explore theories that have been underexplored in HCI literature, such as Motive Disposition Theory (MDT).\n\nMTurk's flexibility allows for a wide range of experimental designs, from simple surveys to more complex interactive tasks, which could be particularly useful in testing MDT's concepts of implicit and explicit motives in digital environments. For example, researchers could design studies that explore how individual differences in motives influence user behavior and preferences in various digital interfaces or online platforms.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that using MTurk for HCI research comes with potential limitations. (LLM MEMORY, 2024) Researchers must be aware of possible sample biases, as MTurk workers may not be fully representative of the general population. Additionally, ensuring data quality and participant engagement can be challenging in online environments. To mitigate these issues, careful study design, implementation of attention checks, and robust data validation processes are essential.\n\nDespite these challenges, MTurk's potential for testing psychological theories in HCI contexts remains significant. Its ability to quickly gather large amounts of data from diverse participants could accelerate the exploration of theories like MDT in HCI research, potentially leading to new insights and more effective user-centered design approaches.\n\nLimitations of Current HCI Approaches\nTLDR: Traditional HCI approaches often struggle to create lasting behavior change, particularly in areas like consumption behaviors. This limitation stems from the difficulty in translating conscious, reflective behaviors into unconscious habits.\n\nCurrent approaches in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) face significant challenges when it comes to effecting long-term behavioral changes, particularly in domains such as sustainable consumption.  (3, Walker et al., 2014) highlights a critical limitation of traditional persuasive technology in HCI: while it can encourage users to reflect on their behaviors during a study, it lacks mechanisms to transform these conscious reflections into unconscious habits. This gap between short-term awareness and long-term habit formation presents a substantial obstacle for HCI researchers and designers aiming to create lasting impact through their interventions.\n\nThe inability to bridge the gap between conscious reflection and unconscious habit formation suggests that many current HCI approaches may be fundamentally limited in their capacity to produce enduring behavioral changes  (3, Walker et al., 2014). This limitation is particularly evident in areas like consumption behaviors, where habitual actions often occur without conscious thought. As a result, interventions that rely solely on raising awareness or prompting conscious decision-making may fall short in achieving their long-term goals.\n\n(LLM MEMORY, 2024) To address these limitations, future HCI research may need to explore new paradigms that can more effectively translate temporary conscious behaviors into lasting unconscious habits. This could involve integrating insights from psychological theories like Motive Disposition Theory (MDT), as discussed earlier, to better understand and leverage the interplay between implicit and explicit motivations in shaping user behavior. By acknowledging and working to overcome these current limitations, HCI researchers can strive to develop more effective approaches that lead to meaningful and sustainable behavioral changes in users.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(3, Walker et al., 2014) | n_citations: 68 | Patterns of persuasion for sustainability ]: \nIndividuals may be able to be reflective about their hitherto reflexive behaviors for the length of a study, but traditional persuasive technology has no mechanism for transferring this conscious thinking to unconscious habit... suggesting that this approach is unlikely to ever produce lasting change in consumption behaviors.\n\n\n\n"}

These metrics help assess the trade-offs between data protection and model performance.\n\nDifferential privacy systems are commonly evaluated using a set of key performance metrics that balance privacy protection with model utility. The primary metrics include:\n\n1. Accuracy: This fundamental metric measures how well the differentially private model performs its intended task compared to non-private baselines  (28, Jayaraman et al., 2020)  (87, Tian et al., 2024). Researchers often report accuracy loss, which quantifies the relative decrease in test accuracy of private models compared to their non-private counterparts  (28, Jayaraman et al., 2020)  (75, Zhang et al., 2023).\n\n2. Privacy Guarantee: This metric, typically expressed as the privacy budget (\u03b5), quantifies the level of privacy protection provided by the system  (38, Jiang et al., 2021)  (81, Demelius et al., 2023). A lower \u03b5 value indicates stronger privacy guarantees but often comes at the cost of reduced utility.\n\n3. Utility: This metric assesses the usefulness of the differentially private output for its intended purpose. It can be measured using various task-specific metrics such as F-score, precision, and recall  (87, Tian et al., 2024).\n\n4. Privacy-Utility Trade-off: Many evaluations focus on the relationship between privacy protection and model utility, often visualized through privacy-utility curves  (81, Demelius et al., 2023).\n\n5. Communication Efficiency: In distributed differential privacy settings, the communication cost between parties is also considered a key performance metric  (19, Kairouz et al., 2019).\n\n6. Resilience to Attacks: Some researchers evaluate the robustness of differentially private systems against specific attacks, such as gradient leakage attacks, measuring both the adverse effect on accuracy and the attack cost  (40, Liu et al., 2021).\n\nThese metrics collectively provide a comprehensive evaluation of differential privacy systems, allowing researchers and practitioners to assess the balance between privacy protection and model performance.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(19, Kairouz et al., 2019) | n_citations: 4708 | Advances and Open Problems in Federated Learning ]: \nWe point out that in distributed differential privacy three performance metrics are of general interest: accuracy, privacy and communication, and an important goal is nailing down the possible trade-offs between these parameters.\n\n7.

These metrics typically involve comparing privacy guarantees against various utility measures across different privacy budgets.\n\nThe evaluation of differential privacy systems often centers around the fundamental trade-off between privacy protection and model utility. This trade-off is typically characterized by the following metrics and approaches:\n\n1. Privacy Budget vs. Accuracy: Researchers commonly evaluate the relationship between the privacy budget (\u03b5) and model accuracy. Lower \u03b5 values provide stronger privacy guarantees but often result in reduced accuracy  (81, Demelius et al., 2023). This trade-off is often visualized through privacy-utility curves, showing how accuracy changes as privacy guarantees strengthen or weaken.\n\n2. Error Bounds: Theoretical analysis of privacy-utility trade-offs has established that the outputs protected by an \u03b5-differentially private mechanism have a maximum error proportional to 1/\u03b5  (58, Zhang et al., 2022). This relationship provides a fundamental understanding of the trade-off dynamics.\n\n3. Accuracy Loss: A common metric is the accuracy loss, defined as the ratio or difference in performance between a differentially private model and its non-private counterpart  (30, Zhao et al., 2020)  (61, Lu et al., 2022). This metric directly quantifies the utility cost of applying differential privacy.\n\n4. Privacy Leakage: Some evaluations measure privacy leakage, often in the context of specific attacks like membership inference. This can be quantified as the difference between true positive and false positive rates of such attacks  (61, Lu et al., 2022).\n\n5. Task-Specific Utility Metrics: Depending on the application, various utility metrics may be employed. For instance, in generative models, fidelity measures and area under the curve (AUC) comparisons have been used to evaluate performance across different privacy budgets  (82, Truda, 2023).\n\n6. Multi-Dimensional Trade-offs: Some studies explore more complex trade-offs, incorporating additional dimensions such as fairness alongside privacy and utility  (42, Pannekoek et al., 2021).\n\n7. Information-Theoretic Metrics: Advanced evaluations may employ information-theoretic measures such as maximal information, maximal leakage, R\u00e9nyi differential privacy, and mutual information to quantify privacy, while using metrics like average Hamming distance to measure utility  (65, Bu et al., 2022).\n\n8. Comparative Analysis: Researchers often compare different privacy mechanisms (e.g., local vs. centralized differential privacy) in terms of their privacy-utility trade-offs, assessing which implementations provide the most desirable balance  (23, Grassal et al., 2019).\n\nBy employing these metrics and approaches, researchers and practitioners can comprehensively evaluate the privacy-utility trade-offs in differential privacy systems, enabling informed decisions about the appropriate balance for specific applications and privacy requirements.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Multi-method evaluations can integrate various combinations of quantitative and qualitative approaches.\n\nMixed methods research typically involves the integration of quantitative and qualitative methodologies to provide a comprehensive analysis of complex phenomena. However, the scope of data analysis tools for mixed methods research extends beyond this traditional dichotomy. According to Bauer, multi-method evaluations can encompass a broader range of combinations, including multiple quantitative methods, multiple qualitative methods, or a mix of both  (8, Bauer, 2020). This flexibility in approach allows researchers to tailor their analysis tools to the specific needs of their study, potentially enhancing the accuracy and depth of their findings.\n\nThe concept of multi-method evaluations suggests that researchers can employ a diverse set of analytical tools, each suited to different aspects of their data. For instance, a study might use statistical software for quantitative analysis, qualitative coding software for textual data, and visualization tools for presenting integrated results. This approach can provide a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the research subject (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nIt's important to note that the selection of appropriate data analysis tools should be guided by the research questions, the nature of the data collected, and the overall objectives of the study. The integration of various analytical approaches can help researchers address complex research problems that may not be adequately explored through a single methodological lens (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These tools enhance accuracy and replicability in data analysis, particularly for longitudinal and multilevel studies.\n\nThe accuracy and rigor of data analysis tools are crucial for the validity of mixed methodology research studies. One notable approach that has gained traction is the quantitizing mixed methods approach, exemplified by usage feature analysis in linguistics.

These models are particularly effective for analyzing data in medical, social, and agricultural sciences, where complex data structures are common  (6, Luers et al., 2019). The implementation of mixed models for longitudinal studies, including Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials (SMARTs), can be accomplished using standard mixed model software. This accessibility to established software packages further contributes to the accuracy and reliability of the analysis process.\n\nThe combination of quantitizing approaches and mixed effects models offers researchers a robust toolkit for addressing the complexities inherent in mixed methodology studies. These tools not only enhance the accuracy of data analysis but also improve the replicability of research findings, a critical aspect of scientific rigor.

These approaches aim to provide more accessible and efficient alternatives to traditional polysomnography.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing the diagnosis of sleep apnea, offering potential solutions to the limitations of traditional polysomnography (PSG)  (2, Thorey et al., 2019). Researchers have developed a range of AI-based approaches utilizing different physiological signals and machine learning techniques to detect sleep apnea events.\n\nOne prominent approach involves the use of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for sleep apnea detection. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models in analyzing ECG data to identify apnea episodes  (30, Gandhi et al., 2023)  (17, He et al., 2022)  (73, Zarei et al., 2019). For instance, Gandhi et al. proposed a 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) model that achieved high accuracy (94.77%) in detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) from single-lead ECG signals  (30, Gandhi et al., 2023).\n\nAnother significant approach utilizes respiratory signals for apnea detection. Pang et al. developed an intelligent OSA diagnosis system using deep learning algorithms based on nasal pressure airflow signals  (9, Pang et al., 2021). Similarly, Shen et al. proposed a multiscale feature extraction algorithm and a classifier with weighted-loss and time-dependence for OSA detection, achieving high accuracy in both segment and individual identification  (6, Shen et al., 2021).\n\nResearchers have also explored the use of multiple physiological signals in combination with advanced AI techniques. Pourbabaee et al. constructed a dense recurrent convolutional neural network (DRCNN) to detect sleep disorders using various polysomnography measurement channels  (3, Pourbabaee et al., 2019). This approach demonstrates the potential of leveraging multiple data sources for more comprehensive sleep apnea diagnosis.\n\nNovel non-intrusive methods for sleep apnea detection have also been developed. Shin et al. introduced SlAction, a system that uses infrared videos to detect OSA in daily sleep environments, achieving an average F1 score of 87.6%  (29, Shin et al., 2023). This approach highlights the potential for less invasive diagnostic tools that can be used in home settings.\n\nThe performance of AI-based sleep apnea detection methods has been promising. Several studies have reported high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in detecting apnea events  (6, Shen et al., 2021)  (30, Gandhi et al., 2023)  (90, Lee et al., 2020).

Many models achieve accuracy rates above 85%, with some reaching over 90%, indicating their potential for clinical application.\n\nThe performance and accuracy of AI models for sleep apnea detection have shown significant promise across various approaches and datasets. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated particularly strong results. For instance, a 1D-CNN model analyzing single-lead ECG signals achieved impressive accuracy (94.77%), precision (93.80%), sensitivity (92.55%), and specificity (96.14%)  (30, Gandhi et al., 2023). Similarly, a 1D deep CNN model using single-lead ECG signals reported 87.9% accuracy, 92.0% specificity, and 81.1% sensitivity for per-minute apnea detection  (90, Lee et al., 2020).\n\nOther deep learning approaches have also shown high performance. A multiscale feature extraction algorithm based on deep learning achieved 89.4% accuracy, 89.8% sensitivity, and 89.1% specificity in segment identification for OSA detection  (6, Shen et al., 2021). The TFFormer model, which uses a time-frequency information fusion-based CNN-Transformer framework, demonstrated superior OSA detection performance compared to other methods  (26, He et al., 2023).\n\nNon-intrusive detection methods have also shown promise. SlAction, a system using infrared videos for OSA detection in daily sleep environments, achieved an average F1 score of 87.6%  (29, Shin et al., 2023). This highlights the potential for less invasive diagnostic tools that can be used in home settings.\n\nTraditional machine learning algorithms have also demonstrated high accuracy when combined with appropriate feature extraction techniques. A study using Support Vector Machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and Naive Bayes (NB) for ECG-based OSA detection found that SVM achieved the best classification accuracy at 97.14%  (21, Javeed et al., 2023).\n\nSome studies have focused on developing more accessible and portable solutions. A small, low-cost wearable apnea diagnostic system using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals and random forest algorithms achieved an accuracy of over 85%  (213, Xia et al., 2023). Additionally, lightweight models like MobileNet V1, when combined with recurrent neural networks, have achieved accuracies of around 90%  (218, Hemrajani et al., 2023).\n\nWhile these results are promising, it's important to note that performance can vary depending on the specific dataset and evaluation criteria used. Some studies report lower accuracies, such as 84% for apnea detection and 74% for desaturation detection using deep learning techniques  (12, Buskova et al., 2021). However, the overall trend suggests that AI models are capable of achieving high accuracy in sleep apnea detection, often comparable to or exceeding traditional diagnostic methods.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These technologies aim to improve treatment efficacy, patient adherence, and overall management of sleep apnea.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the treatment and management of sleep apnea, offering innovative solutions to improve patient care and outcomes. AI technologies are being applied in various aspects of sleep apnea management, from treatment selection to monitoring and outcome prediction.\n\nOne of the key applications of AI in sleep apnea treatment is personalized therapy selection. Machine learning algorithms can analyze patient data to predict the outcomes of different treatment options, allowing clinicians to tailor interventions more effectively  (20, Kirby et al., 2023). This approach can significantly improve treatment success rates by identifying the most suitable interventions for individual patients  (220, Dhillon et al., 2023).\n\nAI is also being used to enhance continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, the primary treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Machine learning models can optimize CPAP settings and predict treatment adherence, potentially improving long-term outcomes (214, Batool-Anwar et al., 2023). Additionally, AI algorithms can analyze data from CPAP devices to provide insights into treatment efficacy and patient compliance  (28, Surani et al., 2023).\n\nReal-time monitoring of sleep apnea is another area where AI is making significant contributions. IoT-based sleep apnea monitoring systems, integrated with AI algorithms, can track relevant parameters in real-time, allowing for immediate intervention when necessary  (7, Dhruba et al., 2021). These systems can collect data on sleep patterns and breathing, enabling machine learning algorithms to detect signs of sleep apnea and potentially prevent adverse events  (28, Surani et al., 2023).\n\nAI is also advancing our understanding of sleep apnea physiology and etiology. Machine learning techniques are being used to identify specific markers of OSA and analyze the relationships between various physiological parameters  (34, Wang et al., 2024)  (15, Maheshwari et al., 2022). This improved understanding can lead to more effective treatment strategies and help clinicians address the underlying mechanisms of the disease.\n\nFurthermore, AI is facilitating the identification of OSA endotypes and phenotypes, which can inform more targeted treatment approaches. Advanced statistical methods and machine learning algorithms are being used to uncover subgroups with differential treatment outcomes, paving the way for more personalized interventions  (267, Shah et al., 2024).\n\nIn the context of sleep studies, AI is being employed to improve the analysis of polysomnography (PSG) and home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) data. AI algorithms can provide consistent and reliable scoring of sleep stages and respiratory events, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of sleep disorder diagnosis and treatment monitoring  (216, Anderer et al., 2023).\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, its integration into sleep medicine is expected to grow, offering new possibilities for improving the diagnosis, treatment, and management of sleep apnea  (212, M et al., 2023). By leveraging these advanced technologies, clinicians can enhance their ability to provide personalized, effective care for patients with sleep apnea, potentially leading to better treatment outcomes and improved quality of life.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These measures typically use hierarchical relationships, information content, or a combination of approaches to assess similarity.\n\nSemantic similarity measures are automated methods for quantifying the likeness between pairs of concepts within an ontology or taxonomy  (67, Mumtaz et al., 2020). These measures are particularly useful in life sciences, where they can be applied predictively to identify underlying biological relations based on similarities between ontological features  (60, Kulmanov et al., 2019). The primary goal of these measures is to assess the semantic distance between concepts according to a given ontology, which is crucial for tasks such as mapping terms or concepts across different domain-specific ontologies  (37, Slimani, 2013).\n\nOntology-based semantic similarity measures typically rely on the \"is-a\" relations found in the underlying taxonomy or ontology  (66, Jiang et al., 2020). These measures can be broadly classified into three categories: path-based, feature-based, and information content (IC) based approaches  (50, McInnes et al., 2016). Path-based methods often utilize graph-based features such as the shortest path length between concepts and the position of their lowest common ancestors to capture semantic similarity  (66, Jiang et al., 2020).\n\nInformation Content (IC) based methods have gained significant attention in the field. These approaches estimate the IC of ontology terms to compute similarity  (42, Warren et al., 2014). Notable examples include Resnik's similarity measure and Lin's similarity measure, which can be combined with strategies like best-match average for assessing pairwise class similarities  (60, Kulmanov et al., 2019).\n\nThe computation of semantic similarity typically involves mapping concepts to an ontology and examining their relationships within it  (33, Reshadat et al., 2012). This process allows for the estimation of similarity between hierarchically expressed concepts, providing a foundation for various applications in fields where structured knowledge representation is crucial.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(33, Reshadat et al., 2012) | n_citations: 7 | Studying of Semantic Similarity Methods in Ontology ]: \nOntology-based semantic similarity techniques can estimate the semantic similarity between two hierarchically expressed concepts in a given ontology or taxonomy. Semantic similarity is usually computed by mapping concepts to ontology and by examining their relationships in it.\n\n\n\nApproaches considering multiple inheritance\nTLDR: Approaches to semantic similarity that consider multiple inheritance aim to capture more comprehensive relationships between concepts. These methods often extend traditional measures by incorporating additional information from multiple parent concepts or shared child terms.\n\nMultiple inheritance in ontologies presents unique challenges for semantic similarity measures, as concepts can have relationships with multiple parent concepts. To address this complexity, several approaches have been developed that extend beyond traditional single-inheritance methods  (1, Banu et al., 2014). One such approach proposes an extension of the Wu & Palmer measure by considering All Subsumed Concepts (ASC), which helps capture a greater amount of explicit knowledge in taxonomies with multiple inheritance  (1, Banu et al., 2014).\n\nSun et al. suggest taking all superconcepts into account to obtain more semantic evidence in cases of multiple inheritance, leading to more accurate similarity measures  (3, Sun et al., 2015). This approach aligns with the idea of considering the common specificity feature of evaluated concepts, which can provide a more nuanced understanding of concept relationships.\n\nIn the context of the Gene Ontology (GO), which allows multiple parents for each concept, Brass et al. propose a measure based on the information content of shared parents, considering that two terms can share parents through multiple paths  (9, Brass et al., 2003). This method has gained significant attention in the field, as evidenced by its high citation count.\n\nTo further enhance similarity assessment, some researchers have introduced measures that go beyond inheritance relationships. Pirr\u00f3 et al. propose the Extended Information Content (eIC), which investigates various types of ontological relations between concepts to provide a better indicator of concept features (23, Pirr\u00b4o et al., 2010).\n\nThe DiShIn method, introduced by Silva et al., offers a flexible approach that can be integrated into various semantic similarity measures dependent on shared information content  (26, Silva et al., 2011). This method is particularly valuable for developing multi-domain similarity measures that effectively exploit multiple inheritance.\n\nKim et al. suggest incorporating a descending measure for computing semantic similarity, justified by the existence of multiple inheritances and the likelihood of semantically similar terms sharing child terms  (31, Kim et al., 2012). This approach contrasts with previous methods that only considered a partial view of the modeled knowledge in the ontology  (27, Valls et al., 2011).\n\nSome researchers have focused on specific aspects of multiple inheritance, such as investigating cases where the path length is equal through parent concept and sub-concept links  (35, Feng, 2012). Others have proposed calculating semantic similarity on concepts using string matching and WordNet, while addressing multiple inheritance in relationship calculations  (36, Donglin et al., 2012).\n\nThese approaches demonstrate the ongoing efforts to develop more comprehensive and accurate semantic similarity measures that can handle the complexities of multiple inheritance in ontologies.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(1, Banu et al., 2014) | n_citations: 2 | A New Ontology-Based Semantic Similarity Measure for Concepts Subsumed by Multiple Super Concepts ]: \nThere exist four approaches to calculate the semantic similarity... For such taxonomies using only the LCS will ignore a great amount of explicit knowledge. To overcome this limitation we propose ontology based semantic similarity measure which extends Wu & Palmer measure by considering ASC :( All Subsumed Concepts).\n\n2. [(3, Sun et al., 2015) | n_citations: 5 | An Ontology-Based Semantic Similarity Measure Considering Multi-Inheritance in Biomedicine ]: \nThen, we propose a new measure considering the multiple inheritance in ontologies and the common specificity feature of the evaluated concepts in order to obtain a more accurate similarity between concepts... To solve the problem, we can take all the superconcepts into account and try to get more semantic evidence in the case of multiple inheritance, which makes the measure for semantic similarity more accurate.\n\n3. [(9, Brass et al., 2003) | n_citations: 934 | Investigating Semantic Similarity Measures Across the Gene Ontology: The Relationship Between Sequence and Annotation ]: \nOnce we have calculated these probabilities, there are a variety of different mechanisms for calculating the semantic similarity between terms... This measure is based on the information content of shared parents of the two terms, as defined in Equation ( 1), where S(c1, c2) is the set of parental concepts shared by both c1 and c2.As GO allows multiple parents for each concept, two terms can share parents by multiple paths.\n\n4. [(23, Pirr\u00b4o et al., 2010) | n_citations: 180 | A Feature and Information Theoretic Framework for Semantic Similarity and Relatedness ]: \nHowever, since an ontology usually contains relations beyond inheritance also useful to assess to what extent two concepts are alike, the Extended Information Content (eIC ) is introduced.eIC by investigating each kind of ontological relation between concepts provides a better indicator about the features of concepts and then can be used to compute relatedness.\n\n5. [(26, Silva et al., 2011) | n_citations: 75 | Disjunctive shared information between ontology concepts: application to Gene Ontology ]: \nDiShIn can be easily integrated in any semantic similarity measure dependent on the information content shared by two concepts...

Thus, methods like DiShIn will certainly represent a valuable contribution for the development of multi-domain similarity measures based on an effective exploitation of multiple inheritance.\n\n6.

[(36, Donglin et al., 2012) | n_citations: 0 | Instance Duplicate Elimination Mechanism in Electronic Catalog Ontology Merging ]: \nsemantic similarity on concepts is calculated by string matching and Wordnet,that on attributes is calculated according to both data-type and object-type,and that on relationships is calculated based on multi-inheritance.\n\n\n\nInformation Content (IC) based methods for multiple inheritance\nTLDR: IC-based methods for multiple inheritance in ontologies calculate similarity by considering shared information between concepts. These approaches often incorporate common ancestors, descendants, and disjunctive paths to provide more comprehensive similarity measures.\n\nHere's a list of notable IC-based methods that address multiple inheritance in ontology semantic similarity:\n\n1. Closest Common Parent (CCP): This approach considers the Information Content of the closest common parent when computing semantic similarity between concept pairs  (2, Ur et al., 2015).\n\n2. Multiple Inheritance Node IC Computing: Zhang et al. proposed a new IC computing model specifically designed for multiple inheritance nodes in WordNet taxonomy  (4, Zhang et al., 2018).\n\n3. Most Informative Common Ancestor: Several measures, including Lin's, Resnik's, Jiang and Conrath's, and SimRel, are based on this concept and are supported by tools like REVIGO (25, \u0160kunca et al., 2011).\n\n4. Multi-ontology Least Common Subsumer: For scenarios involving multiple ontologies, the IC of the Least Common Subsumer from both ontologies is used to estimate semantic similarity  (63, Chandrasekaran et al., 2020).\n\n5. Resnik's Measure: This notable approach uses a taxonomy with multiple inheritance as the representational model, basing semantic similarity on the notion of information content  (38, Gan et al., 2013).\n\n6. DiShIn and GraSM: These methods improve semantic similarity measures by considering common ancestors and descendants of terms  (39, Guo et al., 2013).\n\n7. IC-based Partial Ordered Set Comparisons: These measures assess similarity by evaluating the amount of shared and distinct information between compared classes in a taxonomy or partial ordered set  (40, Janaqi et al., 2013).\n\n8. S\u00e1nchez's Approach: This method incorporates multiple inheritance through the number of subsumers, differing from previous studies  (64, AlMousa et al., 2020).\n\n9. GraSM and DiShIn Add-ons: These methods average the information contents of common disjunctive ancestor terms (GraSM) or slightly modify this approach (DiShIn) to enhance semantic similarity calculations  (51, Agapito et al., 2016).\n\nThese IC-based methods demonstrate the ongoing efforts to develop more nuanced and accurate semantic similarity measures that can effectively handle the complexities of multiple inheritance in ontologies.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(2, Ur et al., 2015) | n_citations: 6 | Information Content Based Semantic Similarity Measure for Concepts Subsumed By Multiple Concepts ]: \nAnalyzing the IC-based methods, we notice that these measures consider Information Content of the Closest Common Parent (CCP) for a given pair of concepts whose semantic similarity is computed.\n\n2.

These methods involve distributing multiple copies of data across different nodes to mitigate the impact of node failures or user attrition.\n\nPeer-to-Peer (P2P) storage systems offer an alternative to traditional client-server architectures, providing improved scalability and fault tolerance while eliminating single points of failure  (2, Tari et al., 2023). To address the inherent unreliability of individual nodes in these systems, replication and redundancy techniques are essential  (43, Datta et al., 2010). These methods are crucial for maintaining data availability in the face of various challenges, such as disk failures or peer \"churning\" in P2P storage systems  (44, Rouayheb et al., 2010).\n\nOne approach to implementing redundancy is to network multiple storage nodes together, creating a distributed data storage system that can maintain a desired level of reliability  (46, Pawar et al., 2010). This strategy not only increases data availability but also provides fault tolerance, scalability, and improved performance  (167, Masinde et al., 2020).\n\nRecent advancements in replication techniques include the Replication based on Performance and Data Placement (RPDP) method, which selects nodes based on their throughput and latency to achieve lower overall latency and balanced data distribution  (2, Tari et al., 2023). Additionally, P2P storage systems can be designed as either unstructured or structured networks. Structured systems provide a mapping between data identifiers and locations, allowing for efficient query routing to nodes with the desired data  (195, Tiago et al., 2022).\n\nTo maintain system reliability, P2P storage systems often aim to keep a specific number of active, non-failed storage nodes in service at all times  (44, Rouayheb et al., 2010). When a storage node fails, it needs to be repaired or replaced to maintain the desired level of system reliability  (46, Pawar et al., 2010). Many P2P systems use a combination of replication strategies to achieve reliable data storage and retrieval  (167, Masinde et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(2, Tari et al., 2023) | n_citations: 0 | RPDP: An Efficient Data Placement based on Residual Performance for P2P Storage Systems ]: \nStorage systems using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture are an alternative to the traditional client-server systems. They offer better scalability and fault tolerance while at the same time eliminate the single point of failure... RPDP places data to most appropriate selected nodes based on their throughput and latency with the aim to achieve lower overall latency by balancing data distribution with respect to the individual performance of nodes.\n\n2. [(43, Datta et al., 2010) | n_citations: 247 | Self-repairing homomorphic codes for distributed storage systems ]: \nBecause of storage node failures, or user attrition in a peerto-peer system, redundancy is essential in networked storage systems.\n\n3. [(44, Rouayheb et al., 2010) | n_citations: 178 | Securing Dynamic Distributed Storage Systems Against Eavesdropping and Adversarial Attacks ]: \nAn important design problem for such systems arises from the individual unreliability of the system nodes due to many reasons, such as disk failures... or peer \"churning\" in peer-to-peer storage systems... To guarantee a certain desired level of reliability, we assume that the DSS is required to always have n active, i.e., non-failed, storage nodes that are simultaneously in service.\n\n4. [(46, Pawar et al., 2010) | n_citations: 67 | On secure distributed data storage under repair dynamics ]: \nTo solve this problem and to increase the reliability of the stored data, multiple storage nodes can be networked together to redundantly store the data, thus forming a distributed data storage system... However, what distinguishes the scenario here from the erasure channel counterpart is that when a storage node fails, it needs to be repaired or replaced by a new node in order to maintain a desired level of system reliability.\n\n5. [(167, Masinde et al., 2020) | n_citations: 31 | Peer-to-Peer-Based Social Networks: A Comprehensive Survey ]: \nDesigning a reliable storage mechanism is aimed at ensuring data availability and in P2P systems...

These systems provide a mapping between the data identifier and location, so that queries can be efficiently routed to the node(s) with the desired data\n\n\n\nErasure Coding and Network Coding\nTLDR: Erasure coding and network coding are advanced techniques used to enhance data reliability and efficiency in P2P storage systems. These methods offer improved storage efficiency compared to simple replication while maintaining or improving data availability and repair capabilities.\n\nErasure coding and network coding represent significant advancements in ensuring the reliability of P2P storage systems. These techniques offer improvements over traditional replication methods by providing better storage efficiency while maintaining or enhancing data availability and repair capabilities  (76, Koyluoglu et al., 2012).\n\nIn distributed storage systems (DSS), erasure coding allows for data to be split into fragments and distributed across multiple nodes. This approach enables the system to recover the original data even if some nodes fail, as long as a sufficient number of fragments remain accessible. Network coding builds upon this concept by allowing nodes to combine and process data before transmission or storage, potentially improving system performance and resilience  (146, Lingam et al., 2018).\n\nOne notable advancement in this field is the concept of functional repair, where a failed node is not exactly replicated but instead regenerated in a way that preserves the overall system's reliability properties. This approach, known as the \"any k out of n\" property, ensures that the system can recover the original data from any k out of n storage nodes  (76, Koyluoglu et al., 2012). However, in many cases, exact repair is preferable, where the regenerated data is an exact replica of what was stored on the failed node.\n\nRecent research has focused on improving the efficiency and resilience of erasure and network coding techniques. For instance, some approaches propose coding schemes that provide extra protection through cooperation among neighboring nodes in heterogeneous distributed storage networks (DSNs). These methods can achieve faster recovery speeds compared to existing network coding methods and correct more erasure patterns  (173, Yang et al., 2020).\n\nThe reliability of a storage system using these coding techniques can be measured by its minimum distance, which represents the maximum number of node failures the system can tolerate before data loss becomes unrecoverable  (176, Wang et al., 2020). This metric helps in designing systems with the desired level of fault tolerance.\n\nRegenerating codes based on interference alignment concepts have also been developed to achieve optimal performance in distributed storage systems. These codes not only provide data reliability but also perform efficient exact node repair when failures occur. The interference alignment approach is particularly important for improving repair efficiency in minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes  (151, Marina et al., 2018).\n\nBy incorporating these advanced coding techniques, P2P storage systems can achieve a balance between storage efficiency, data availability, and repair capabilities, addressing the reliability challenges inherent in distributed environments.\n\nReferences:\n1.

However, it is desirable to perform exact repair in DSS, where the data regenerated after the repair process is an exact replica of what was stored on the failed node.\n\n2.

Our scheme can achieve faster recovery speed compared with existing network coding methods, and can correct more erasure patterns compared with our previous work.\n\n4. [(176, Wang et al., 2020) | n_citations: 0 | On the Optimal Minimum Distance of Fractional Repetition Codes ]: \nThe minimum distance of this storage system, denoted by d min , is the number of nodes such that 1) there exists at least one set of d min nodes whose erasures leads to the unrecoverable loss of the source data; 2) the stored file can be recovered for any subset of d min -1 node erasures.\n\n5. [(151, Marina et al., 2018) | n_citations: 0 | Improving the Secrecy of Distributed Storage Systems using Interference Alignment ]: \nRegenerating codes based on the approach of interference alignment for wireless interference channel achieve the cut-set bound for distributed storage systems. These codes provide data reliability, and perform efficient exact node repair when some node fails. Interference alignment as a concept is especially important to improve the repair efficiency of a failed node in a minimum storage regenerating (MSR) code.\n\n\n\nDistributed Hash Tables (DHTs)\nTLDR: Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are a key component in P2P storage systems, providing efficient data location and retrieval mechanisms. DHTs enhance system reliability by enabling content-addressed storage, load balancing, and robust data distribution across the network.\n\nDistributed Hash Tables (DHTs) play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and efficiency of P2P storage systems. One of the primary challenges in these networks is efficiently locating and retrieving stored data, which DHTs address through content-based addressing  (192, Zhang et al., 2022). This approach allows P2P storage networks to overcome the limitations of centralized indexing systems, making them more resilient and scalable.\n\nA notable implementation of DHTs in P2P storage is the Cooperative File System (CFS), which utilizes a distributed hash lookup algorithm called DHash  (6, Stoica et al., 2001). DHash enhances system reliability through several mechanisms:\n\n1. Fine-grained block distribution and caching for improved load balancing\n2. Replication for increased robustness\n3. Server selection techniques to reduce latency\n\nThese features contribute to a more balanced and responsive storage system, reducing the risk of bottlenecks and single points of failure.\n\nThe reliability of DHT-based storage systems is further emphasized in the context of decentralized highly available databases  (193, Iancu et al., 2022). The ability of DHTs to reliably store and retrieve data is essential for supporting request processing services in distributed environments. This property makes DHTs particularly suitable for building robust and fault-tolerant P2P storage systems.\n\nBy leveraging DHTs, P2P storage systems can achieve efficient data location and retrieval, load balancing, and robust data distribution. These characteristics contribute significantly to the overall reliability and performance of the storage network, addressing key challenges in distributed data management.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(192, Zhang et al., 2022) | n_citations: 3 | Kadabra: Adapting Kademlia for the Decentralized Web ]: \nA key challenge in the p2p storage networks outlined above is how to efficiently locate where a desired piece of data is stored in the network... Instead, p2p storage networks rely on a distributed hash table (DHT) protocol for storage and retrieval by content addressing data.\n\n2. [(6, Stoica et al., 2001) | n_citations: 1867 | Wide-area cooperative storage with CFS ]: \nCFS layers storage on top of an eff\u00c9cient distributed hash lookup algorithm... CFS servers provide a distributed hash table (DHash) for block storage... DHash distributes and caches blocks at a fine granularity to achieve load balance, uses replication for robustness, and decreases latency with server selection.\n\n3. [(193, Iancu et al., 2022) | n_citations: 3 | Towards a Highly Available Model for Processing Service Requests Based on Distributed Hash Tables ]: \nThis last property is essential to a reliable storage system based on DHTs, such as a decentralized highly available database... which can reliably store the data needed by any request processing service.\n\n\n\nBlockchain-based Solutions\nTLDR: Blockchain technology is being integrated into P2P storage systems to enhance data reliability, security, and traceability. These solutions often combine blockchain with distributed file systems like IPFS to create more robust and decentralized storage networks.\n\nBlockchain technology has emerged as a promising approach to address reliability and security challenges in P2P storage systems. By leveraging the immutable and distributed nature of blockchains, these solutions aim to improve data integrity, traceability, and fault tolerance in decentralized environments  (194, Dhingra et al., 2022).\n\nOne notable implementation combining blockchain with P2P storage is the integration of distributed file systems (DFSs) like Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) and Swarm with blockchain technologies. These systems offer low-latency data retrieval, fault-tolerant guarantees, and decentralized storage solutions  (164, Huang et al., 2020). The synergy between blockchain and DFSs can be observed in approaches that use off-chain storage (such as IPFS) for raw transaction records, while storing their addressable hashes in the blockchain. This strategy helps preserve system scalability while maintaining data integrity  (180, Tripathi et al., 2021).\n\nTo further enhance data security and efficiency in blockchain-based P2P storage systems, some solutions incorporate additional techniques. For instance, Huffman compression can be used for file size optimization, while RSA encryption can be applied to ensure data security  (194, Dhingra et al., 2022). These methods contribute to more efficient storage utilization and improved data protection in the distributed environment.\n\nIn private P2P file sharing networks, blockchain technology can be used to improve quality of service and auditability by tracing file access. Such systems may combine a distributed hash table (DHT) network for distributing encrypted files with redundancy among partner peers, and a blockchain network for managing secret shares  (162, Roth, 2019). This approach enhances both data availability and security in the P2P storage system.\n\nIt's worth noting that several systems are already addressing the challenges of P2P data storage by combining blockchain technology with conventional databases. Examples include BigchainDB, ChainSQL, and Sproof, which aim to leverage the strengths of both blockchain and traditional database systems to create more reliable and efficient storage solutions  (158, Tschuchnig et al., 2019).\n\nBy integrating blockchain technology with existing P2P storage techniques, these solutions aim to address key reliability concerns such as data integrity, fault tolerance, and secure access management. The combination of blockchain's immutability and distributed consensus mechanisms with the efficiency of P2P storage architectures presents a promising direction for enhancing the overall reliability of decentralized storage systems.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These techniques range from traditional replication to advanced erasure coding methods, aiming to minimize repair bandwidth and maintain system reliability.\n\nIn P2P storage systems, the ability to repair and recover from node failures is crucial for maintaining data reliability. Traditional approaches often relied on simple replication, but more advanced techniques have emerged to improve efficiency and robustness  (135, Aktas et al., 2017). One key advancement is the use of erasure coding, particularly locally repairable codes (LRCs), which provide a more storage-efficient way to achieve desired reliability levels.\n\nWhen node failures occur, repair processes are triggered to regenerate lost data. In some systems, this involves connecting to a set of surviving nodes and downloading a specific amount of data from each  (186, Mital et al., 2021)  (145, Li et al., 2018). The concept of repair bandwidth is crucial, as it directly impacts the system's efficiency and recovery speed. Some advanced techniques, such as repair-by-transfer, allow helper nodes to transfer stored data to replacement nodes without performing arithmetic operations, potentially reducing computational overhead  (140, Li et al., 2017).\n\nThe frequency of data repair is an important consideration in P2P storage systems. Research has shown how to optimize this frequency to balance reliability and resource usage  (93, Wang et al., 2014). Additionally, distributed repair mechanisms have been developed, where new storage nodes can independently download data from existing nodes to recover lost fragments  (143, Calis et al., 2017).\n\nRobustness is a critical factor in repair mechanisms. Locally repairable codes (LRCs) address this by incorporating multiple repair groups, ensuring that the system can maintain functionality even when some nodes cannot provide sufficient repair bandwidth  (136, Mahdaviani et al., 2017)  (142, Tebbi et al., 2017). This approach helps prevent cascading failures and maintains system reliability.\n\nSome innovative approaches to repair and recovery include partial repair processes, where caching nodes broadcast packets to all other nodes to recover erased data  (116, Xiao et al., 2015). This method can be particularly useful in scenarios where complete node failure is less common than partial data loss.\n\nOverall, the field of repair and recovery mechanisms in P2P storage systems continues to evolve, with a focus on minimizing repair bandwidth, improving efficiency, and maintaining high levels of data reliability in the face of node failures and data loss.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(142, Tebbi et al., 2017) | n_citations: 3 | Linear Programming Bounds for Distributed Storage Codes ]: \nA major issue of locally repairable codes is their robustness.

For partial repair, caching node i broadcasts r i packets to all other nodes.\n\n\n\nData Integrity and Security Measures\nTLDR: P2P storage systems employ various techniques to ensure data integrity and security, including provable data possession, encryption, and decentralized verification mechanisms. These measures aim to protect against data breaches, unauthorized access, and maintain reliability in distributed environments.\n\nData integrity and security are paramount concerns in P2P storage systems, given the decentralized nature of these networks and the potential for untrusted nodes. To address these challenges, researchers and developers have proposed and implemented various innovative solutions.\n\nOne significant advancement in ensuring data integrity is the concept of multiple-replica provable data possession (MR-PDP), which provides strong evidence that multiple copies of data are actually stored in the system  (32, Khan et al., 2008). This approach helps verify the presence and integrity of replicated data across untrusted storage nodes.\n\nDecentralized storage systems often leverage erasure coding techniques in combination with careful storage node selection and reputation systems to enhance protection against data breaches  (179, Daniel et al., 2021). These systems also incorporate measures for deployment, naming, access control, DDoS attack protections, and churn protection to create a more robust and secure storage environment.\n\nRecent advancements include the development of BFT-DSN, which combines storage-weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus with erasure coding, homomorphic fingerprints, and weighted threshold signatures for decentralized verification  (206, Ranjan et al., 2024). This approach aims to improve Byzantine resilience in decentralized storage networks while maintaining competitive performance in terms of storage cost and latency.\n\nEncryption plays a crucial role in enhancing data protection in P2P storage systems. For instance, some implementations utilize IPFS technology with added features such as redundancy and encryption to create a decentralized and secure storage solution  (196, Kumar et al., 2023). By distributing encrypted data across nodes, these systems minimize the risk of single-point failures and enhance data availability.\n\nTo further improve security and reliability, some storage systems employ a combination of techniques, including elliptic cryptography, erasure codes, secret sharing schemes (SSSs), and error correction codes (166, Rivera-Rodriguez et al., 2020). These methods work together to spread data securely across multiple storage providers or nodes.\n\nAt the file system level, reliability can be achieved through techniques such as Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID), snapshots, journaling, and checksums  (156, Dubeyko, 2019). Some systems also implement Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) and consensus algorithms like Raft to ensure atomicity, durability, and reliable file distribution  (177, Yang et al., 2020).\n\nFor P2P systems that need to guarantee the integrity, authenticity, and availability of stored data, the Data Protection pattern is recommended  (123, Amoretti et al., 2016). This pattern provides a framework for implementing comprehensive security measures in distributed storage environments.\n\nAs P2P storage systems continue to evolve, researchers are exploring optimized Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) schemes specifically designed for large-scale decentralized storage networks  (201, Baldimtsi et al., 2023). These efforts aim to address limitations in existing models and improve the overall security and efficiency of decentralized storage solutions.\n\nBy implementing these various data integrity and security measures, P2P storage systems can provide more robust, secure, and reliable alternatives to centralized storage solutions, addressing key concerns in distributed data management and storage.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This ambiguity can manifest in various forms, from vague initial requests to changing requirements over time.\n\nUser intents often exhibit ambiguity, presenting challenges for automated systems attempting to interpret and respond to user needs. This ambiguity can take several forms:\n\n1. Unclear or inaccurate instructions: Users may struggle to articulate their intentions clearly, especially when dealing with complex or unfamiliar tasks. This can lead to ambiguous or imprecise instructions that automated systems find difficult to interpret accurately  (29, Li et al., 2022).\n\n2. Unexpressed or evolving intentions: Users may not always know exactly what they want at the outset of an interaction. Their intentions can be initially vague or may evolve as they engage with the system, requiring a more dynamic approach to intent recognition  (24, Tanaka et al., 2021).\n\n3. Complex multi-turn interactions: In real-world settings, determining a user's true intent often requires multiple rounds of dialogue. This is particularly true when dealing with intricate or nuanced requests that cannot be fully captured in a single interaction  (36, Hao et al., 2023).\n\n4. Changing context and requirements: User intentions can change over time due to shifting contexts or evolving needs. This dynamism poses challenges for context-aware systems that may be designed to provide standardized services based on initial assumptions about user intent  (7, Oyama et al., 2011).\n\nUnderstanding these types of ambiguity is crucial for developing effective methods to elicit and clarify user intents, especially in scenarios where automated systems encounter uncertainty or potential failure cases.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(29, Li et al., 2022) | n_citations: 3 | MUG: Interactive Multimodal Grounding on User Interfaces ]: \nHowever, in a realistic scenario, user instructions can be ambiguous or inaccurate especially when the target action is difficult or inconvenient to articulate.\n\n2. [(24, Tanaka et al., 2021) | n_citations: 5 | ARTA: Collection and Classification of Ambiguous Requests and Thoughtful Actions ]: \nExisting task-oriented dialogue systems assume that user intentions are clarified and uttered in an explicit manner; however, users often do not know what they want to request.\n\n3. [(36, Hao et al., 2023) | n_citations: 0 | IntentDial: An Intent Graph based Multi-Turn Dialogue System with Reasoning Path Visualization ]: \nAlthough accurately capturing a customer's intent from just a single round of a dialogue is desirable, in real-world settings, due to the ambiguity and complexity of user questions, it is often more feasible to progressively determine the user's underlying intent across several rounds of a dialogue.\n\n4. [(7, Oyama et al., 2011) | n_citations: 6 | Inference of Human Intentions in Context Aware Systems ]: \nHuman intention in context aware systems can evolve at any time, however, context aware systems based on these context models can provide only standard services that are often insufficient for specific user needs. Consequently, evolving human intentions result in changes in system requirements.\n\n\n\nProactive Clarification Methods\nTLDR: Proactive clarification methods anticipate and address potential ambiguities in user intents before they lead to errors. These approaches include inferring uncertainty, providing context, generating targeted questions, and optimizing the user's decision-making environment.\n\n1. Uncertainty Inference: Systems can benefit from employing mechanisms to infer and exploit uncertainty about a user's intentions and focus  (2, Horvitz, 1999). This approach allows for proactive clarification by anticipating areas where user intents might be ambiguous.\n\n2. Context Enhancement: Providing users with better context about what the system knows and how well it can interpolate or extrapolate helps users refine their own intents in complex settings. This method can reveal subtle low-level inconsistencies in desired task requirements that might otherwise lead to undesirable behaviors  (9, Israelsen et al., 2017).\n\n3. Visual Uncertainty Mapping: Dialogue systems can map visual uncertainty to an ambiguity state and generate questions that suitably elucidate the ambiguity the robot is facing  (23, Pramanick et al., 2021). This approach directly addresses potential sources of confusion in visual tasks.\n\n4. POMDP-based Question Generation: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) can model the uncertainty a robot faces during intent recognition, enabling it to ask information-seeking questions  (35, Konidaris et al., 2023). This method allows for structured, probabilistic reasoning about ambiguities.\n\n5. Optimal Environment Nudging: Intent disambiguation can be framed as a problem of optimally adjusting the user's decision-making context. By carefully modifying the environment, the system can ensure that the user's subsequent actions provide maximal information about their latent intentions  (30, Thompson et al., 2022). This approach proactively shapes the interaction to clarify intents more effectively.\n\nThese proactive methods aim to address potential ambiguities before they lead to errors or misunderstandings, complementing the types of ambiguity discussed in the previous section.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(2, Horvitz, 1999) | n_citations: 1296 | Principles of mixed-initiative user interfaces ]: \nIn many cases, systems can benefit by employing machinery for inferring and exploiting the uncertainty about a user's intentions and focus.\n\n2.

These approaches include asking clarifying questions, providing options for user selection, and employing rule-based techniques to resolve uncertainties.\n\n1. Clarifying Questions: When uncertainty about query intent is detected, systems can ask targeted questions to reveal the user's actual information need  (12, Zamani et al., 2020)  (13, Hashemi et al., 2020). This approach is particularly useful in conversational search systems and can enhance retrieval effectiveness  (32, Ni et al., 2023).\n\n2. Option Selection: Presenting users with a set of possible intents as buttons or quick responses can effectively acquire correct intentions while reducing miscommunication  (14, Li et al., 2020). This method gives users a sense that the system is actively trying to understand their intentions.\n\n3. Rule-Based Techniques: Applications can employ rule-based approaches to ask users about their actual intent when ambiguity is detected  (1, Gu et al., 0)  (6, Das et al., 2008).\n\n4. Ambiguity Widgets: Interactive elements can be incorporated into user interfaces to allow users to correct imprecise system decisions caused by ambiguity  (22, Shen et al., 2021).\n\n5. Context-Based Explanations: Guiding users to explain their intents in the context of application GUIs can help avoid unclear utterances  (10, Li et al., 2019).\n\n6. Discriminative Question Generation: For queries ambiguous between two intents, systems can generate discriminative questions using rule-based methods, leveraging existing question generation systems  (15, Dhole, 2020).\n\n7. Open-Ended Clarification Requests: To prevent user frustration, systems can generate open-ended requests that explicitly mention two or three of the most likely interpretations  (16, Jackson et al., 2020).\n\n8. Mixed-Initiative Setups: In conversational search scenarios, systems can alternate between user queries and system answers, as well as system questions and user responses to clarify information needs  (26, Mass et al., 2021).\n\n9. User Involvement in Visual Tasks: For visual inputs with ambiguity or uncertainty, systems can involve users in resolving these issues, combining automated planning and execution monitoring to track task states and recover from mistakes  (21, Mohomed et al., 2020).\n\nThese reactive methods complement the proactive approaches discussed earlier, providing a range of tools for systems to address ambiguity in user intents as they arise during interactions.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(12, Zamani et al., 2020) | n_citations: 63 | Analyzing and Learning from User Interactions for Search Clarification ]: \nTo address these shortcomings, (conversational) search engines can clarify the user information needs by asking a question, when there is an uncertainty in the query intent.\n\n2.

[(32, Ni et al., 2023) | n_citations: 2 | A Comparative Study of Training Objectives for Clarification Facet Generation ]: \nSince user queries can be ambiguous or vague, query intent clarification is beneficial to enhance user experience and retrieval effectiveness... some studies utilize predicted intents to generate clarifying questions, clarifying intent by asking questions to the user.\n\n4.

This calls for a mixed-initiative setup. User-asks (queries) and system-answers, as well as system-asks (clarification questions) and user response, in order to clarify her information needs.\n\n12. [(21, Mohomed et al., 2020) | n_citations: 2 | Interactive Planning-based Cognitive Assistance on the Edge ]: \nTo address these limitations, in this paper, we propose (i) to involve users in resolving the ambiguity/uncertainty of visual inputs and (ii) to employ automated planning tools as well as execution monitoring techniques to keep track of the task states, as well as to generate new plans to recover from users' mistakes if necessary.\n\n\n\nModeling and Tracking User Intent Uncertainty\nTLDR: Systems model user intent uncertainty using probabilistic approaches and interactive techniques. These methods allow for dynamic tracking of user goals, handling ambiguity, and adapting to changing intentions over time.\n\nModeling and tracking user intent uncertainty is crucial for systems to effectively handle ambiguity and adapt to changing user needs. Several approaches have been developed to address this challenge:\n\n1. Probabilistic Behavior Modeling: User interactions with control interfaces can be modeled as probabilistic goal-directed actions. This approach allows systems to reason about user intentions with adjustable rationality, accounting for uncertainty in user inputs  (11, Jain et al., 2019).\n\n2. Uncertainty Classification: Systems can be designed to identify instances of high aleatoric uncertainty, where user intent is inherently ambiguous, and low epistemic uncertainty, where the system's knowledge is insufficient. This classification helps in determining when and how to seek clarification  (31, Choi et al., 2023).\n\n3. Semantic Ambiguity Handling: When user intent expressions contain semantic ambiguity, AI/ML techniques become necessary to infer the intended meaning. This approach bridges the gap between expressed and intended intents  (33, Glassman, 2023).\n\n4. Dialog State Tracking: Statistical models have been developed to track the system's belief in user intentions over multiple interaction turns. These models can incorporate reinforcement learning to optimize strategies for resolving uncertainties  (28, Buschmeier et al., 2022).\n\n5. Context-Aware Problem Identification: Interaction context can provide valuable cues for systems to automatically identify problematic situations and infer user intent. This approach leverages the evolving information goals of users during the interaction process  (4, Chai et al., 2006).\n\n6. Cognitive Robotic Engines: Advanced systems can automatically generate perceptual behaviors to select and collect optimal sets of evidence. This approach aims to enable robust recognition of human intention under high levels of uncertainty and ambiguity  (5, Baek et al., 2007).\n\nThese methods for modeling and tracking user intent uncertainty complement the proactive and reactive clarification approaches discussed earlier. By employing these techniques, systems can maintain a dynamic understanding of user goals, adapt to changing intentions, and effectively resolve ambiguities throughout the interaction process.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(11, Jain et al., 2019) | n_citations: 80 | Probabilistic Human Intent Recognition for Shared Autonomy in Assistive Robotics ]: \nWe therefore model the user's interaction with the control interface as probabilistic goal-directed actions to allow for uncertainty in reasoning about the user's intention... We consider the user control inputs as representative of the action the user wants to take and build a probabilistic behavior model with adjustable rationality to inform human intent recognition.\n\n2. [(31, Choi et al., 2023) | n_citations: 6 | Clarify When Necessary: Resolving Ambiguity Through Interaction with LMs ]: \nResolving ambiguities through interaction is a hallmark of natural language, and modeling this behavior is a core challenge in crafting AI assistants... We evaluate systems across three NLP applications: question answering, machine translation and natural language inference... Systems for this task must identify instances with high aleatoric uncertainty, where the user's intent is ambiguous, and low epistemic uncertainty\n\n3. [(33, Glassman, 2023) | n_citations: 2 | Designing Interfaces for Human-Computer Communication: An On-Going Collection of Considerations ]: \nIf the user expresses their intent in a way that requires no inference, e.g., as statement(s) in a programming language or as a push of a button that invokes a pre-programmed function, then the system can just execute the expressed intent... If the intent expression has any semantic ambiguity, it is necessary for the system to incorporate some AI/ML to perform inference about the intended intent.\n\n4. [(28, Buschmeier et al., 2022) | n_citations: 12 | Modeling Feedback in Interaction With Conversational Agents\u2014A Review ]: \nSince these corrections were in themselves also associated with uncertainties, statistical models were developed for tracking the system's belief in the user's intentions over multiple turns...

[(4, Chai et al., 2006) | n_citations: 6 | Towards Conversational QA: Automatic Identification of Problematic Situations and User Intent ]: \nRecent studies have also shown that the capability to automatically identify problematic situations during interaction can significantly improve the system performance...

[(5, Baek et al., 2007) | n_citations: 3 | Cognitive Robotic Engine: Behavioral Perception Architecture for Human-Robot Interaction ]: \nWe present here \"Cognitive Robotic Engine (CRE)\" that automatically generates such perceptual behaviors as selecting and collecting an optimal set of evidences, for dependable and robust recognition of human intention under a high level of uncertainty and ambiguity.\n\n\n\nConsiderations for Effective Intent Elicitation\nTLDR: Effective intent elicitation requires balancing proactive clarification with user experience. Strategies should minimize user frustration while maintaining safety and system effectiveness.\n\n1. Balance Clarification and Context Understanding: When employing large language models (LLMs) in virtual assistants, it's crucial to strike a balance between seeking clarification and leveraging contextual understanding. While strategies like prompt engineering and parameter tweaking can enhance proactive recovery, excessive clarifications may lead to user frustration. Finding the right equilibrium is essential for maintaining a superior user experience  (34, Mahmood et al., 2023).\n\n2. Minimize Perceived False Alarms: In the context of driving automation, distraction detection systems should be designed to minimize perceived false alarms. This approach can help reduce problems of distrust in the system, which is particularly important when humans are expected to supervise or interact with automated systems  (17, Happee et al., 2020).\n\n3. Manage User Awareness of Backup Systems: For certain applications, such as driving automation, it may be beneficial to keep the status of backup systems unannounced. This strategy can help mitigate issues of overreliance on automated systems, encouraging users to remain engaged with the primary task  (17, Happee et al., 2020).\n\n4. Adapt Elicitation Methods to Task Complexity: The approach to intent elicitation should be tailored to the complexity of the task at hand. For instance, in driving scenarios, eye-tracking systems can be used to retain the human as the primary driver, with computerized control only activating when necessary  (17, Happee et al., 2020).\n\n5. Consider User Cognitive Load: When designing intent elicitation methods, it's important to consider the cognitive load placed on users. Elicitation strategies should aim to clarify intents without overwhelming users or significantly disrupting their primary task (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nBy taking these considerations into account, systems can more effectively elicit user intents while maintaining a positive user experience and ensuring safety in critical applications. These strategies complement the proactive and reactive clarification methods discussed earlier, providing a holistic approach to handling ambiguity in user intents.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(34, Mahmood et al., 2023) | n_citations: 1 | LLM-Powered Conversational Voice Assistants: Interaction Patterns, Opportunities, Challenges, and Design Guidelines ]: \nStrategies such as prompt engineering and tweaking model parameters may increase proactive recovery; however, overcorrection and excessive clarifications can frustrate users... Therefore, a balance between an LLM-powered VA seeking clarification and leveraging its contextual understanding is crucial for superior user experience.\n\n2. [(17, Happee et al., 2020) | n_citations: 6 | Redesigning Today\u2019s Driving Automation Toward Adaptive Backup Control With Context-Based and Invisible Interfaces ]: \nHumans are likely inadequate for supervising today's on-road driving automation. Conversely, backup concepts can use eye-tracker DMS to retain the human as the primary driver and use computerized control only if needed. A distraction DMS where perceived false alarms are minimized and the status of the backup is unannounced might reduce problems of distrust and overreliance, respectively.\n\n\n\n"}
{"case_id": "3d8c315aed4cc104f2ad61f4deeda9c1", "answer_text": "Detection and Tracking Techniques\nTLDR: Person-following robots employ various detection and tracking techniques, primarily utilizing computer vision and sensor fusion. Key approaches include feature-based tracking, machine learning algorithms, and multi-sensor integration for robust performance in challenging environments.\n\nPerson-following robots rely on a range of sophisticated detection and tracking techniques to effectively identify and follow their target human. These methods often combine computer vision algorithms with sensor data to achieve robust performance in diverse environments.\n\nOne common approach is the use of feature-based tracking algorithms. For instance, some systems employ point-based features like Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) to detect humans under challenging conditions such as variations in illumination, pose changes, and partial occlusions  (2, Gupta et al., 2017). Other methods utilize Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) in combination with Support Vector Machines (SVM) for human detection  (4, Win et al., 2017).\n\nMachine learning techniques play a significant role in modern person-following systems. Deep learning-based approaches, such as the use of MobileNetSSD for object detection combined with metric learning-based re-identification models like DaSiamRPN, have shown promise in recent research  (142, Kim et al., 2023). These methods can provide improved accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.\n\nMulti-sensor fusion is another key strategy for enhancing detection and tracking capabilities. Many systems integrate data from various sensors, such as laser range finders (LRF), cameras, and depth sensors. For example, some robots use LRF for leg detection in combination with camera-based face detection, fusing this information using techniques like the Unscented Kalman Filter  (32, Bellotto et al., 2009). Other approaches combine millimeter-wave radars with cameras to handle challenges like occlusion and overlapping  (118, Zhu et al., 2021).\n\nThe Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a popular tool for person tracking, especially when dealing with mobile platforms. It allows for the consideration of both the robot's and the target person's movements, enabling accurate tracking even during short periods of occlusion  (35, Miura et al., 2009)  (38, Miura et al., 2010).\n\nSome notable systems focus on specific body parts for more reliable tracking. For instance, tracking the torso using a laser range finder has been recommended for robust performance in outdoor environments  (44, Jung et al., 2012). Others utilize 3D vision-based human-skeleton tracking, allowing for more advanced interaction modalities such as following a person walking in front of the robot or responding to pointing gestures (68, Jevti\u0107 et al., 2015).\n\nRecent advancements have also explored the use of omnidirectional platforms combined with real-time visual perception systems. These approaches allow for precise adjustment of the robot's orientation while monitoring a person during navigation  (124, Chiaberge et al., 2022).\n\nIn summary, the field of person-following robot navigation continues to evolve, with researchers exploring various detection and tracking techniques to improve robustness, accuracy, and adaptability in diverse real-world scenarios.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This paper presents a novel human-centered navigation system that successfully combines a real-time visual perception system with the mobility advantages provided by an omnidirectional robotic platform to precisely adjust the robot orientation and monitor a person while navigating.\n\n\n\nOcclusion Handling and Re-identification\nTLDR: Person-following robots employ various techniques to handle occlusions and re-identify targets, including feature-based tracking, machine learning models, and multi-sensor fusion. These methods enable robots to maintain tracking during temporary obstructions and reliably re-acquire targets after loss of visual contact.\n\nPerson-following robots face significant challenges when dealing with occlusions and the need to re-identify targets in dynamic environments. To address these issues, researchers have developed a range of sophisticated techniques that enhance the robustness and reliability of tracking systems.\n\nOne common approach involves the use of feature-based tracking algorithms combined with machine learning models. For instance, some systems employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for human pose detection, which allow for robust tracking even during long-term occlusions  (3, Welsh, 2017). These models can be further enhanced by incorporating identity embeddings, enabling the system to maintain tracking across consecutive frames despite temporary visual obstructions.\n\nAdvanced person re-identification (Re-ID) techniques play a crucial role in recovering targets after occlusion or temporary disappearance from the robot's field of view. Many systems utilize feature-based template matching or trajectory replication to re-identify individuals when they reappear  (5, Hong et al., 2018). Some approaches fuse anonymous person trackers with face recognizers to continuously track and identify people even when face recognition temporarily fails  (6, Morris et al., 2020).\n\nRecent advancements in Re-ID include the development of incrementally learned appearance models that capture more knowledge about the target person over time. These models have shown superior performance in challenging scenarios, such as occlusions and the presence of visually similar individuals  (9, He et al., 2023). Additionally, some systems employ online boosting methods to continuously update features in every frame, improving target identification in dynamic environments  (7, Choi et al., 2022).\n\nMulti-sensor fusion has emerged as a powerful strategy for enhancing occlusion handling and re-identification capabilities. By combining data from various sensors, such as cameras, depth sensors, and millimeter-wave radars, robots can more effectively track targets through occlusions and overlapping  (118, Zhu et al., 2021). Some systems utilize 3D vision-based human-skeleton tracking, which allows for more reliable person localization even when only a subset of joints is visible  (8, Pan et al., 2023).\n\nThe Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) remains a popular tool for person tracking, especially when dealing with mobile platforms and temporary occlusions. EKF-based algorithms can consider the movement of both the robot and the target, allowing for accurate tracking even when the person is briefly occluded by others  (35, Miura et al., 2009)  (38, Miura et al., 2010).\n\nSome notable approaches focus on integrating multiple technologies to create more robust tracking systems. For example, combining visual Re-ID with gesture detection and collision-free navigation has shown promise in enabling robots to identify and follow target persons in complex environments  (10, Amadio et al., 2023). Other systems incorporate optical tracking to support neural network inferences, allowing for more accurate position determination using RGB-D cameras (11, Fern\u00e1ndez-Conde et al., 2023).\n\nIn summary, the field of person-following robotics continues to evolve, with researchers exploring various occlusion handling and re-identification techniques to improve robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios. By combining advanced computer vision algorithms, machine learning models, and multi-sensor fusion approaches, modern systems are better equipped to maintain tracking through occlusions and reliably re-acquire targets after visual contact is lost.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Key approaches include convolutional neural networks for pose detection, online learning models for adaptive tracking, and deep learning-based object detection combined with metric learning for robust re-identification.\n\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence have become integral to advancing person-following robot navigation, offering enhanced capabilities in detection, tracking, and re-identification. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for human pose detection have emerged as a powerful tool for robust person tracking, even during long-term occlusions  (3, Welsh, 2017). These models can be augmented with identity embeddings to maintain tracking across consecutive frames despite temporary visual obstructions.\n\nRecent advancements in person re-identification (Re-ID) have led to the development of incrementally learned appearance models. These models capture more knowledge about the target person over time, enabling successful Re-ID in challenging scenarios involving occlusions and visually similar individuals  (9, He et al., 2023). Some systems employ online boosting methods to continuously update features in every frame, improving target identification in dynamic environments  (7, Choi et al., 2022).\n\nDeep learning-based object detection combined with metric learning-based re-identification has shown promise in recent research. For instance, some approaches leverage MobileNetSSD for object detection in conjunction with DaSiamRPN for re-identification, offering a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency  (142, Kim et al., 2023). Other systems utilize region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) for Re-ID tasks, addressing challenges related to intentional or unintentional occlusions  (141, Islam et al., 2023).\n\nMulti-modal approaches that combine visual Re-ID with gesture detection and collision-free navigation have demonstrated success in enabling robots to identify and follow target persons in complex environments  (10, Amadio et al., 2023). Some frameworks integrate human skeleton tracking with discriminative correlation filters to achieve real-time and reliable control for mobile service robots  (111, Li et al., 2020).\n\nOnline learning techniques have also been applied to trajectory prediction, allowing robots to adapt their following behavior based on the historical path of the target person  (115, Choi et al., 2021). This adaptive approach enhances the robot's ability to anticipate and respond to changes in the target's movement patterns.\n\nWhile many of these AI-driven approaches show promising results, researchers continue to work on improving robustness against full occlusions and adapting to highly dynamic environments  (130, Pantawane et al., 2022).

These approaches enable robots to track and follow humans efficiently in dynamic environments.\n\nReal-time processing and performance are crucial aspects of person-following robot navigation, as they directly impact the system's ability to interact with and respond to dynamic environments. Recent advancements in this field have focused on developing efficient algorithms and leveraging multi-modal sensing to achieve robust real-time performance.\n\nOne approach to enhancing real-time capabilities is the use of lightweight detection and tracking algorithms. For instance, some researchers have proposed a pedestrian segmentation detection algorithm combined with a nearest neighbor tracker to ensure real-time pedestrian tracking for mobile robot applications  (148, He et al., 2023). This method is particularly useful when computational resources are limited, allowing for efficient processing without sacrificing accuracy.\n\nMulti-modal sensing has emerged as a powerful strategy for improving real-time performance. By combining various sensor inputs, robots can achieve more reliable and accurate tracking. For example, some systems utilize 3D Kinect sensors to detect, track, and follow humans in real-time, leveraging depth information, skeleton data, and color information from the 3D camera  (132, Hai et al., 2022). This approach not only enables efficient tracking but also allows for re-identification of targets when they disappear and reappear in the frame.\n\nAdvanced machine learning techniques have also been employed to enhance real-time processing and performance. Some frameworks combine human skeleton tracking with discriminative correlation filters to achieve reliable control for mobile service robots  (111, Li et al., 2020). These methods have demonstrated improved accuracy, with total accuracy rates reaching up to 84.3% in experimental settings.\n\nAdaptive trajectory prediction is another area of focus for improving real-time performance. Some systems incorporate online learning techniques to predict target trajectories based on historical path data  (115, Choi et al., 2021). This approach allows robots to anticipate and respond to changes in the target's movement patterns more effectively, enhancing overall following performance.\n\nResearchers have also explored the use of vision-based perception techniques to enable robots to approach target persons directly  (131, Li et al., 2022). These methods aim to improve the intelligence and efficiency of following robots by leveraging knowledge of the target human's predicted movements.\n\nTo address challenges in diverse environments, some studies have focused on developing people tracking approaches for specific scenarios. For instance, methods have been proposed for robots following people in open outdoor environments using stereo cameras, as well as RGB-D multi-person tracking approaches for crowded indoor environments  (150, Benhabib et al., 2024).\n\nThe ultimate goal of these real-time processing and performance enhancements is to achieve active perception, enabling robots to follow people effectively despite their movement  (87, Kim et al., 2018). As research in this field continues to advance, we can expect further improvements in the responsiveness and adaptability of person-following robots in dynamic real-world scenarios.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These techniques include neural network-based approaches, time-frequency analysis, and decomposition-based methods, which are better suited for handling complex real-world signals.\n\nNon-linear and non-stationary signals are commonly encountered in various fields, including time series analysis, bioinformatics, and geostatistics  (41, Remes et al., 2017). Traditional linear methods, such as Fourier spectral analysis and wavelet transforms, have been widely used for signal decomposition, even for non-stationary signals  (27, Cicone et al., 2015). However, these linear techniques are often too simplistic to accurately describe real-world systems  (3, Hsieh, 2004).\n\nTo address the limitations of linear methods, several non-linear and non-stationary signal processing techniques have been developed. Neural network-based methods have gained popularity since the late 1980s for performing non-linear regression, classification, and various analyses such as non-linear Principal Component Analysis (NLPCA), non-linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (NLCCA), and non-linear Singular Spectrum Analysis (NLSSA)  (3, Hsieh, 2004). These neural-based approaches are well-equipped to handle non-stationarity and non-linearity in real-world problems, making them effective for analyzing complex geophysical data  (24, YILMAZ et al., 2014).\n\nTime-frequency analysis methods have proven powerful for processing non-linear and non-stationary data  (44, Machado et al., 2017). These techniques aim to improve upon wavelet and Fourier transform-based methods in dealing with non-stationary signals  (102, Cicone et al., 2021). Examples of such methods include the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Multivariate Intrinsic Function (MIF), which are designed to naturally handle non-stationary signals originating from non-linear systems  (29, Cicone et al., 2015).\n\nDecomposition-based techniques have also emerged as important tools for non-linear and non-stationary signal processing. These include synchrosqueezed wavelet transforms (SSWT), variational mode decomposition (VMD), eigenvalue decomposition (EVD), and Fourier decomposition methods (FDM)  (37, Singh, 2016). Additionally, optimization techniques are often employed in these alternative methods to decompose non-stationary and non-linear signals  (27, Cicone et al., 2015).\n\nOther non-linear methodologies applied to complex geophysical time series include detrended fluctuation analysis, chaos theory, and wavelet analysis  (96, Ray et al., 2021). These techniques, along with the aforementioned methods, provide a diverse toolkit for analyzing and processing non-linear and non-stationary signals across various applications, including speech signal analysis, biomedical signal processing, telecommunication engineering, mechanical engineering, and seismic signal processing  (102, Cicone et al., 2021).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These techniques, including short-time Fourier transform, wavelet analysis, and empirical mode decomposition, offer improved capabilities over traditional Fourier analysis for analyzing complex signals in various applications.\n\nTime-frequency analysis methods have emerged as essential techniques for processing non-linear and non-stationary signals, offering significant advantages over traditional Fourier transform-based approaches. These methods are particularly useful in applications such as seismic data processing, radar detection, audio processing, and earthquake early warning systems  (10, Thakur et al., 2010)  (132, Yves et al., 2023).\n\nOne of the most widely used time-frequency analysis techniques is the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), which provides a localized frequency representation of a signal over time  (110, Li et al., 2021). However, the STFT has limitations in terms of time-frequency resolution, leading to the development of more advanced methods.\n\nWavelet analysis has gained prominence as a powerful tool for analyzing non-stationary signals with complex frequency components. It offers better time-frequency localization compared to the STFT and has found applications in seismic wave analysis and earthquake early warning systems  (132, Yves et al., 2023).\n\nThe Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method, introduced by Huang et al., has become a well-established multiresolution technique for decomposing non-linear and non-stationary data. EMD decomposes a signal into a set of finite band-limited Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) through a sifting process, providing a more adaptive approach to signal analysis  (26, Singh et al., 2015)  (20, Hou et al., 2013).\n\nOther notable time-frequency analysis methods include the Wigner-Ville distribution, evolutionary spectrum, and Synchrosqueezed wavelet transforms  (26, Singh et al., 2015). The Synchrosqueezing transform, in particular, has been developed to improve upon traditional wavelet-based methods for analyzing non-uniformly sampled signals  (10, Thakur et al., 2010).\n\nIn the context of seismic data processing, time-frequency denoising techniques have proven effective when noise and seismic signals occupy the same frequency range, a situation where traditional spectral filtering methods often fail  (46, Zhu et al., 2018). Recent advancements have also explored the combination of time-frequency analysis methods with machine learning techniques, such as the integration of S-transform and ResNet50 neural networks for improved seismic signal processing  (110, Li et al., 2021).\n\nThese time-frequency analysis methods provide researchers and practitioners with a diverse set of tools for analyzing and processing complex non-linear and non-stationary signals across various applications, offering improved capabilities compared to traditional Fourier analysis techniques.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The EMD is a well established multiresolution method that decomposes nonlinear and nonstationary data into a set of finite band-limited IMFs and residue through the sifting process.\n\n5. [(20, Hou et al., 2013) | n_citations: 21 | Sparse Time Frequency Representations and Dynamical Systems ]: \nThe Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method of Huang et al [13] provides a completely new way to analyze nonlinear and nonstationary signals... The EMD method decomposes a signal into a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) sequentially... The EMD method has found many applications, see e.g. [30,14,32].\n\n6. [(46, Zhu et al., 2018) | n_citations: 248 | Seismic Signal Denoising and Decomposition Using Deep Neural Networks ]: \nSpectral filtering (usually based on the Fourier transform) is frequently used to suppress noise in routine seismic data processing; however, this approach is not effective when noise and seismic signal occupy the same frequency range... Methods based on time-frequency denoising [20,21] form a large class of seismic denoising techniques.\n\n\n\nDecomposition-based Techniques\nTLDR: Decomposition-based techniques are powerful methods for analyzing non-linear and non-stationary signals by breaking them down into simpler components. These techniques, including Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and its variants, offer adaptive and data-driven approaches that can effectively handle complex signals in various applications.\n\nDecomposition-based techniques have emerged as essential tools for processing non-linear and non-stationary signals. One of the most prominent methods in this category is the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), introduced by Huang et al. in 1998  (49, Li et al., 2018)  (142, Zhou et al., 2023). EMD decomposes a signal into a finite number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and a trend signal, providing a data-driven approach to signal analysis  (25, Kemiha, 2014). Unlike traditional methods such as Fourier and Wavelet transforms that use fixed basis functions, EMD employs local data adaptive basis functions, making it particularly effective for non-linear and non-stationary signals  (83, Gul et al., 2020).\n\nSeveral variants and improvements of EMD have been developed to address its limitations and enhance its performance. These include the Iterative Filtering (IF) method and its faster version, Fast Iterative Filtering (FIF)  (76, Barbe et al., 2020)  (53, Cicone et al., 2018). Other variations such as Adaptive Local Iterative Filtering (ALIF) and Resampled Iterative Filtering (RIF) have been proposed to handle signals with strong non-stationarities, like chirps and whistles  (120, Cicone et al., 2022).\n\nIn addition to EMD-based methods, other decomposition techniques have been developed for non-linear and non-stationary signal processing. These include Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)  (97, Estevez et al., 2021), Fourier Decomposition Method (FDM)  (52, Singh, 2018), and sparse transform methods such as wavelet transform filtering, shearlet transform filtering, and curvelet transform filtering  (154, Lin et al., 2024).\n\nDecomposition-based techniques have shown effectiveness in various applications, including speech signal analysis, ECG processing, climate studies, seismic analysis, and gravitational time-series  (52, Singh, 2018). In geophysical applications, EMD and its variants have been successfully used for analyzing seismic attributes, removing cable strum noise, and attenuating random and coherent seismic noise  (77, Tian et al., 2020).\n\nComparative studies have shown that some decomposition methods outperform others in specific applications. For instance, VMD has been found to be superior to Wavelet Transform (WT) and Ensemble EMD (EEMD) in Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) signal denoising  (45, Xu et al., 2017). The choice of decomposition technique often depends on the specific characteristics of the signal and the requirements of the application.\n\nAs research in this field continues to evolve, new methods are being developed to address the challenges of non-linear and non-stationary signal processing. These include the nonstationary Fourier mode decomposition (NFMD)  (106, Shea et al., 2021) and the combination of decomposition techniques with machine learning approaches (LLM MEMORY, 2024). These advancements continue to expand the toolkit available for analyzing complex signals across various disciplines.\n\nReferences:\n1.

While traditional methods like Fourier transform remain relevant, advanced techniques such as empirical mode decomposition, machine learning approaches, and adaptive filtering have demonstrated superior performance in specific geophysical applications.\n\nThe analysis of geophysical signals often requires sophisticated techniques due to their non-linear and non-stationary nature. Traditional methods like Fourier transform continue to serve as the foundation for many seismic data denoising approaches  (68, Liu et al., 2020). However, advanced signal processing techniques have emerged to address the complexities of geophysical data more effectively.\n\nEmpirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and its variants have shown promise in analyzing seismic signals. These methods can effectively decompose signals into different Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and analyze the time-frequency distribution of seismic data  (58, Bahar et al., 2018). Additionally, adaptive filtering techniques have proven useful in suppressing random noise in seismic data  (68, Liu et al., 2020).\n\nFor seismic event detection, established methods like the Short-Time Average/Long-Time Average (STA/LTA) algorithm remain widely used  (138, Zainab et al., 2023). However, newer approaches, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), have also been developed for seismic phase picking  (126, Li et al., 2022).\n\nMachine learning and deep learning techniques have shown significant potential in geophysical signal processing. For instance, the deep nonlocal regularizer (DNLR) method has been proposed for 3-D seismic denoising, exploiting the nonlocal self-similarity of seismic data under a self-supervised learning framework  (144, Luo et al., 2023). Non-stationary Gaussian Processes have also demonstrated advantages in scenarios where data exhibit non-stationary behavior  (140, Noack et al., 2023).\n\nCompressive sensing (CS) techniques have been explored for seismic processing, although their effectiveness can vary depending on the specific application  (134, Masood et al., 2023). In data assimilation for geophysical applications, particle filters have shown promise for fully nonlinear processing, with recent smoothing schemes working well in high-dimensional geophysical applications  (47, Kunsch et al., 2018).\n\nFor seismic data interpolation, the Coherence-Based Shot Interpolation (CoBSI) method has outperformed several other techniques, including multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) and sparsity-based shot reconstruction methods  (123, Sun et al., 2022). This demonstrates the ongoing development of more effective techniques for specific geophysical signal processing tasks.\n\nIn volcanic earthquake signal analysis, conventional preprocessing techniques like Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) have been improved upon. The use of Dynamic Acoustic Features (DAF) has shown promise in characterizing volcanic earthquake signals  (145, C. et al., 2023).\n\nWhile advanced techniques offer improvements in many cases, traditional methods still play a crucial role. For instance, bandpass filtering remains a standard processing step for suppressing unwanted noise in seismic signals  (139, Brisbourne et al., 2023). Additionally, digital filtering within specific frequency bands and adaptive thresholding schemes are used to isolate pulses under conditions of permanent background noise (129, \u0410.\u041e. et al., 2022).\n\nIn conclusion, while various advanced techniques have shown effectiveness for processing non-linear, non-stationary geophysical signals, the choice of method often depends on the specific characteristics of the signal and the requirements of the application. A combination of traditional and advanced techniques may provide the most robust approach for analyzing complex geophysical data.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This capability involves complex finger movements, palm utilization, and adaptive control strategies to handle diverse object shapes and orientations.\n\nDextrous in-hand manipulation represents a significant challenge in robotics, aiming to replicate the versatility of human hand capabilities  (70, Levine et al., 2019). This skill encompasses a range of abilities that allow robotic hands to interact with objects in complex ways:\n\n1. Object Reorientation: Robotic hands can change the position and orientation of grasped objects without dropping them, a crucial ability for various tasks  (182, Shimamoto et al., 2023). This involves techniques such as object slipping and pivoting to adjust the gripping point and pose of in-hand objects  (128, Zhao et al., 2021).\n\n2. Palm Utilization: Incorporating an active palm in robotic hand design can significantly enhance dexterity (2, Akta\u00b8s et al., 2022). By using all inner surfaces of the hand, including the palm, robots can markedly increase their manipulation capabilities, mimicking human-like dexterity  (198, Dollar et al., 2023).\n\n3. Adaptive Grasping: Dextrous hands can adapt to objects of various shapes and orientations, employing different grasping strategies without relying on wrist movements  (45, Levine et al., 2016). This adaptability is crucial for handling diverse objects in real-world environments.\n\n4. Compliant Control: Implementing compliant control strategies allows for optimal grasping and manipulation, enhancing the robot's ability to interact with objects safely and effectively  (127, Li et al., 2021).\n\n5. Multi-finger Coordination: Dextrous manipulation often requires coordinated movements of multiple fingers, enabling complex tasks such as unscrewing jar caps or orienting objects for packaging  (1, Wood et al., 2020).\n\n6. Enhanced Sensing: Advanced in-hand manipulation techniques can improve the robot's sensing capabilities, allowing for more precise object pose estimation within the palm  (31, Chalon et al., 2013).\n\n7. Simplified Control: Some approaches use hand gestures rather than individual motor control, reducing control dimensionality and potentially simplifying complex manipulation tasks  (208, Cheng et al., 2024).\n\nThese capabilities collectively enable robotic hands to perform a wide range of manipulation tasks, bridging the gap between human and robotic dexterity. However, challenges remain in expanding the manipulation range and maintaining stable grasps across various object shapes and orientations  (182, Shimamoto et al., 2023).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These applications range from assembly tasks and packaging to logistics and warehousing, with ongoing research aimed at improving robotic dexterity in unstructured environments.\n\nDextrous manipulation capabilities are increasingly important in industrial and manufacturing contexts, where robots are expected to perform complex tasks with precision and adaptability  (50, Ozawa et al., 2017). Over the past decade, significant advancements have been made in robotic dexterity, enabling robots to tackle more sophisticated manufacturing tasks  (68, Billard et al., 2019). However, challenges remain in developing robots capable of operating effectively in unstructured and dynamic environments, particularly for tasks such as sorting, packaging, and assembly  (68, Billard et al., 2019).\n\nIndustrial assembly tasks represent a key application area for dextrous robotic manipulation. Robotic grippers designed specifically for known objects and structured environments have been successfully implemented in these settings  (44, Dollar et al., 2016). However, the ability to manipulate unknown objects without high-fidelity contact sensors or extensive workspace exploration remains an open problem, highlighting the need for further advancements in dextrous manipulation techniques  (44, Dollar et al., 2016).\n\nThe potential applications of dextrous in-hand manipulation extend beyond traditional manufacturing to include logistics, warehousing, and even agriculture  (54, Tomizuka et al., 2017). In these contexts, multi-fingered robotic hands often need to adjust their grasping gestures sequentially to accommodate workspace limitations and ensure object stability  (54, Tomizuka et al., 2017). Recent research has explored optimizing robot hand morphology for specific tasks, resulting in custom designs that are cost-effective and highly capable. However, these specialized designs may face challenges in terms of robustness and generalizability in real-world situations  (83, Meixner et al., 2019).\n\nAdvancements in control algorithms, such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), show promise for improving dextrous manipulation in various industrial robotics applications. These include robot arms, automated assembly lines, warehousing, and logistics operations  (206, Zhang et al., 2024). As research progresses, the goal is to develop robotic systems capable of performing increasingly complex manipulation tasks in diverse industrial and manufacturing environments, bridging the gap between human-like dexterity and robotic efficiency.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These technologies aim to replicate human-like dexterity, enabling more natural and functional grasping and manipulation capabilities for users.\n\nDextrous robotic manipulation has significant applications in healthcare and assistive technology, particularly in the development of advanced prosthetic hands and augmentative devices. One notable area of innovation is the creation of wearable robotic fingers that can augment the functionality of a human hand. These devices enable individuals to perform grasping and manipulation tasks with a single hand, which has potential applications not only in healthcare but also in manufacturing and construction  (46, Asada et al., 2016).\n\nIn the field of prosthetics, adaptive hands have gained considerable attention due to their ability to combine robust grasping with dexterous, in-hand manipulation. These prosthetic designs offer increased functionality while maintaining reduced size and weight, making them more practical for everyday use  (82, Gerez et al., 2019). The goal of achieving human-like dexterity in prosthetic hands is crucial for enabling users to perform a wide range of tasks, from grasping objects to executing precise finger movements  (81, Patoglu et al., 2019).\n\nRecent advancements in prosthetic hand design include the development of tendon-driven underactuated compliant fingers. This approach allows the prosthetic hand to naturally adapt its shape to wrap around various object geometries and modulate its stiffness for different tasks. Such features significantly enhance the dexterity and versatility of prosthetic hands, bringing them closer to replicating the capabilities of natural human hands  (81, Patoglu et al., 2019).\n\nThe integration of dextrous robotic manipulation in healthcare and assistive technologies represents a significant step forward in improving the quality of life for individuals with limb differences or motor impairments. As research in this field continues to progress, we can expect to see even more sophisticated and capable prosthetic and augmentative devices that closely mimic the dexterity and functionality of natural human hands.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Future research focuses on improving underactuated designs, enhancing sensing capabilities, and developing more robust control strategies for diverse object handling.\n\nDespite significant advancements in dextrous robotic manipulation, several challenges remain in achieving human-like dexterity and versatility. One of the primary difficulties lies in executing complex in-hand manipulation tasks, even with highly sophisticated hand designs and control schemes  (48, Dollar et al., 2016). This challenge is particularly evident when dealing with objects of irregular shapes or flexible/soft materials, which are common in real-world environments  (40, NYNALA et al., 2014).\n\nTo address these challenges, future research directions are focusing on several key areas:\n\n1. Underactuated and Adaptive Designs: Researchers are exploring underactuated, adaptive hand designs that can effectively immobilize objects using simple, open-loop control. These designs show promise in achieving consistent and repeatable object motion without requiring prior knowledge of object geometry or contact locations  (48, Dollar et al., 2016). The use of structural compliance in these designs facilitates stable grasping and robust manipulation, even under significant environmental uncertainties  (52, Dollar et al., 2017).\n\n2. High Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) Fingers: Hands with high-DoF fingers are being developed to achieve more accurate and versatile manipulations of grasped objects  (163, Lu et al., 2022). These designs aim to replicate the flexibility and precision of human fingers more closely.\n\n3. Enhanced Sensing and Control: Improving the sensing capabilities of robotic hands and developing more sophisticated control algorithms are crucial areas of ongoing research. These advancements will enable robots to better adapt to various object properties and environmental conditions (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\n4. Versatility in Object Handling: Future research aims to develop robotic hands capable of handling a wider range of objects, including those with irregular shapes and flexible materials. This versatility is essential for applications in manufacturing automation and medical rehabilitation  (40, NYNALA et al., 2014).\n\n5. Bridging the Gap to Human-like Dexterity: While significant progress has been made, achieving truly human-like dexterity remains a long-term goal. Future research will continue to focus on improving the overall performance and adaptability of robotic hands in unstructured environments (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nAs research progresses in these areas, we can expect to see robotic hands that are increasingly capable of performing complex manipulation tasks across various applications, from industrial settings to household environments.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These tools aim to make prompt engineering more accessible and support users in exploring LLM capabilities through graphical interfaces and low-code interactions.\n\nResearchers have created a wide array of interfaces to assist users in optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks. One notable approach is the development of visual programming environments for prompt engineering. ChainForge, for instance, is an open-source tool that allows users to design and optimize prompts through a visual interface, supporting sensemaking around LLM outputs  (46, Wattenberg et al., 2023). Similarly, LMCanvas enables writers to create their own LLM-powered writing tools by interacting with \"blocks\" in a canvas, allowing for customization of writing environments and model configurations  (41, Kim et al., 2023).\n\nInteractive dashboards have also emerged as a popular interface type. Cai et al. designed an interface that helps users execute and customize LLM Chains interactively, allowing for calibration of model expectations and debugging of unexpected outputs  (1, Cai et al., 2021). ExploreLLM takes this concept further by providing a structured environment for users to explore different options, navigate through choices and recommendations, and steer models towards more personalized responses, particularly useful for exploratory or sensemaking tasks  (44, Ma et al., 2023).\n\nLow-code and no-code solutions have gained traction as well. Song et al. introduced the Low-code LLM framework, which incorporates six types of simple visual programming interactions supported by clicking, dragging, or text editing to achieve more controllable and stable responses  (20, Song et al., 2023). This approach allows users to incorporate their ideas into the workflow without writing complex prompts.\n\nSome interfaces focus on bridging the gap between natural language and code. Sarkar et al. proposed grounded abstraction matching for data analysis in spreadsheets, which translates code back into naturalistic utterances to help users understand the LLM's actions  (15, Sarkar et al., 2023). ReactGenie takes a similar approach by translating multimodal user commands into a Natural Language Programming Language (NLPL) using neural semantic parsing  (73, Li et al., 2023).\n\nResearchers have also explored ways to enhance user control and guidance in LLM interactions. Prompt Middleware, presented by Mogil et al., offers a framework for generating prompts based on UI affordances, providing varying levels of control to users over the prompt generation process  (37, Mogil et al., 2023). Sensecape uses multilevel abstraction and visuo-spatial organization to support exploration and sensemaking during LLM interactions, improving users' planning and metacognitive processes  (35, Scott et al., 2023).\n\nAs the field evolves, researchers are identifying key needs for LLM-based interfaces. Chen et al. highlighted guidance, personalization, and integration as major requirements for interfaces supporting the programming of Agent-Based Models (ABMs)  (89, Chen et al., 2024). Jain et al. found that specialized LLM-backed GUIs can offer advantages over one-size-fits-all dialogue-based chatbot UIs, suggesting that a mixture of deterministic shortcuts and custom prompts can provide users with multi-level control  (84, Jain et al., 2024).\n\nThese diverse approaches to interface design for LLM optimization demonstrate the ongoing efforts to make LLMs more accessible and user-friendly across various domains and use cases.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Generally, a prompt consists of the following core components: instruction and input.\n\n\n\nChallenges in LLM Interaction Design\nTLDR: Designing effective interactions with LLMs presents numerous challenges, including user comprehension of LLM outputs, integrating human feedback, and optimizing tool selection. Researchers are exploring various approaches to address these issues, from improving instruction-following capabilities to developing frameworks for multi-user collaboration with LLMs.\n\nThe design of user interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) faces several significant challenges. A fundamental issue is users' difficulty in understanding LLM outputs and adapting their prompts accordingly (5, Spencer-Smith et al., 2023). This lack of transparency in LLM decision-making processes can hinder effective user engagement and problem-solving.\n\nTo address complex problems that LLMs cannot solve autonomously, researchers emphasize the importance of integrating human feedback and involvement at various stages of the interaction process  (7, Wang et al., 2023)  (14, Wu et al., 2023). This approach may necessitate the development of systems that can facilitate collaboration between multiple users and LLMs to collectively solve problems.\n\nInstruction-following capability is crucial for LLMs to serve as effective interfaces between humans and AI models  (18, Chen et al., 2023). However, LLMs often struggle with recognizing their capability boundaries and lack awareness of when and how to use external tools effectively  (19, Huang et al., 2023). This challenge is compounded by the vast number of available APIs and tools, making it difficult for LLMs to distinguish between similar functionalities  (28, Mao et al., 2023).\n\nEvaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs remains a complex task, requiring comprehensive assessment of tool selection, argument assignment, and overall effectiveness in addressing user queries  (23, Gao et al., 2023). Researchers are developing benchmarks like METATOOL to evaluate LLMs' tool usage awareness and selection capabilities  (68, Huang et al., 2023).\n\nThe process of optimizing prompts for LLMs, known as prompt engineering, presents its own set of challenges. It often involves a tedious, manual process of balancing quality and cost  (38, Asawa et al., 2023). Some researchers draw parallels between this challenge and the selection barriers in end-user programming  (26, Kim et al., 2023).\n\nLLMs also face difficulties in understanding contextual inputs during user interactions, particularly when presented with extensive background contexts or complex instructions  (31, Gao et al., 2023). This limitation highlights the need for more sophisticated approaches to context processing and user intent understanding.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers are exploring various strategies. These include developing adaptive methods to enhance LLMs' task planning and tool utilization capabilities  (70, Fan et al., 2023), and investigating the potential of breaking down complex tasks into simpler subtasks for improved LLM performance  (71, Maher et al., 2023).\n\nThe field of HCI with LLMs is evolving to support users in thinking more deeply during interactions, integrating their processing abilities with the strengths offered by these systems  (33, SUBRAMONYAM, 2023). This approach aims to create more effective and user-centric LLM interactions, addressing the unique challenges posed by these powerful but complex language models.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Key issues include difficulty in understanding LLM outputs, limited personalization options, and complexities in integrating LLMs with external tools.\n\nDespite the development of various interfaces and tools for LLM optimization, several significant user problems remain unresolved. One of the primary challenges is users' difficulty in understanding and effectively applying LLM instructions, particularly when interacting with feature-rich software. Khurana et al. highlight that users struggle to map LLM instructions to specific software features, suggesting a need for enhanced user experience (UX) design in LLM interfaces  (83, Khurana et al., 2024).\n\nAnother persistent issue is the limited ability for users, especially those without programming skills, to customize or enhance LLM models according to their specific needs. Liang et al. point out that existing interaction paradigms are constrained by inflexibility and lack of persistent learning, restricting users' avenues for personalization  (96, Liang et al., 2024). This limitation is further exacerbated by the computational inefficiencies and lack of user-friendly interfaces in existing frameworks, which complicate the model training and deployment process.\n\nThe integration of LLMs with external tools, while promising, also presents challenges. Lu et al. describe the concept of tool-augmented LLM systems, where an LLM acts as a central controller between users and third-party tools  (102, Lu et al., 2024). However, effectively implementing such systems requires addressing complexities in tool selection, argument assignment, and overall query resolution (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nThese remaining user problems underscore the need for continued research and development in LLM interfaces. Future work should focus on improving the transparency of LLM decision-making, developing more intuitive and customizable user interfaces, and refining the integration of LLMs with external tools to enhance overall user experience and effectiveness.\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "9931fdf53f47af01cd84e446d5676292", "answer_text": "Comparison of First-order and Second-order Operators in Noise Sensitivity\nTLDR: Second-order operators are generally more sensitive to noise in signal processing compared to first-order operators. This increased sensitivity can lead to both advantages and challenges in edge detection and image processing applications.\n\nIn the realm of signal processing, particularly in edge detection and image analysis, the choice between first-order and second-order operators significantly impacts noise sensitivity. The consensus among researchers is that second-order operators exhibit higher sensitivity to noise compared to their first-order counterparts  (5, Ren et al., 2019)  (7, Tang et al., 2021). This increased sensitivity is particularly pronounced with operators like the Laplacian, which are commonly used for edge detection  (1, Zhao et al., 2012).\n\nThe heightened noise sensitivity of second-order operators can be both an advantage and a challenge. On one hand, it allows for more detailed edge detection and can capture finer image details  (6, Zou et al., 2021). However, this sensitivity also means that second-order operators are more susceptible to amplifying noise in the signal, potentially leading to false edge detections or artifacts in the processed image  (8, Alsirhani et al., 2022).\n\nInterestingly, while most sources agree on the higher noise sensitivity of second-order operators, there is some conflicting information. One study suggests that first-order derivative approaches like Sobel, Prewitt, and Robert edge detectors may contain higher noise than second-order filters  (9, Tadem, 2022). However, given the low citation count and contradiction with other sources, this claim should be treated with caution.\n\nIn practical applications, the choice between first-order and second-order operators often involves a trade-off between detail preservation and noise suppression. Second-order operators like the Laplacian can provide more accurate edge detection, especially in environments with moderate noise levels  (10, Liu et al., 2023). However, in highly noisy conditions, first-order operators might be preferred due to their lower sensitivity to noise, albeit at the cost of potentially losing some image details  (5, Ren et al., 2019).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(5, Ren et al., 2019) | n_citations: 5 | Research on Coal-Rock Fracture Image Edge Detection Based on Tikhonov Regularization and Fractional Order Differential Operator ]: \nthe first-order differential edge detection method is easy to lose the image details and the second-order differential edge detection method is more sensitive to noise.\n\n2.

Additionally, the Laplace operator, as a second-order differential operator, exhibits sensitivity to noise, exacerbating its impact.\n\n\n\nReasons for Higher Sensitivity of Second-order Operators\nTLDR: Second-order operators, like the Laplacian, are inherently more sensitive to noise due to their mathematical properties. This increased sensitivity stems from their higher-order differentiation, which amplifies both edge information and noise in signals.\n\nThe higher sensitivity of second-order operators to noise in signal processing can be attributed to several key factors:\n\n1. Higher-order differentiation: Second-order operators, by definition, involve a higher degree of differentiation compared to first-order operators. This mathematical property inherently amplifies both signal features and noise. As Alsirhani et al. point out, \"it is differentiation of a higher order\" which causes the Laplacian operator to \"rejoin the noise again, more so than a first-order operator\"  (8, Alsirhani et al., 2022).\n\n2. Lack of built-in smoothing: Unlike some first-order operators that may incorporate smoothing, second-order operators typically lack this feature. Alsirhani et al. note that the Laplacian operator \"comprises no smoothing,\" which contributes to its heightened noise sensitivity  (8, Alsirhani et al., 2022).\n\n3. Enhanced edge detection capabilities: The very property that makes second-order operators excellent for edge detection also increases their susceptibility to noise. Zhao et al. explain that \"second order derivative operators, such as Laplace operator, are particularly sensitive to edge information and noise\"  (1, Zhao et al., 2012). This dual sensitivity means that while these operators can detect fine edge details, they also amplify noise in the process.\n\n4. Practical implications: The increased noise sensitivity of second-order operators often necessitates additional preprocessing steps in real-world applications. Silva et al. emphasize that the Laplacian operator \"is very sensitive to noise, for which it is rarely used in practice\" without prior noise reduction  (2, Silva et al., 2014). Similarly, Zhao et al. suggest that \"unnecessary noise should be removed before the edge detection\" when using second-order operators  (1, Zhao et al., 2012).\n\n5. Comparative performance: In experimental comparisons, the noise sensitivity of second-order operators becomes evident. Liu et al. observed that \"the Laplace operator, as a second-order differential operator, exhibits sensitivity to noise, exacerbating its impact\" in object detection tasks  (10, Liu et al., 2023).\n\nThese factors collectively explain why second-order operators are generally more sensitive to noise in signal processing applications, necessitating careful consideration and often additional preprocessing steps when used in practice.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(8, Alsirhani et al., 2022) | n_citations: 5 | An Ensembled Spatial Enhancement Method for Image Enhancement in Healthcare ]: \ne Laplacian operator has equal possessions in every direction; however, at present, it comprises no smoothing and will rejoin the noise again, more so than a first-order operator since it is differentiation of a higher order.\n\n2.

Additionally, the Laplace operator, as a second-order differential operator, exhibits sensitivity to noise, exacerbating its impact.\n\n\n\nPractical Implications and Solutions\nTLDR: The high noise sensitivity of second-order operators necessitates careful handling in practical applications. Various solutions have been proposed to mitigate noise issues while preserving the benefits of these operators.\n\n1. Preprocessing for noise reduction: Due to the high noise sensitivity of second-order operators like the Laplacian, it's often necessary to apply noise reduction techniques before edge detection. This approach is commonly used in practice to mitigate the effects of noise  (2, Silva et al., 2014).\n\n2. Combining operators: Some methods combine first-order and second-order operators to balance noise sensitivity and edge detection accuracy. This approach can help preserve fine edge details while reducing the impact of noise (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\n3. Alternative operators: Researchers have developed modified operators that aim to reduce noise sensitivity while maintaining edge detection capabilities. For example, the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operator has been shown to be less affected by noise compared to the standard Laplacian operator  (6, Zou et al., 2021).\n\n4. Fractional order operators: Novel approaches like the Fractional Order Gradient Operator (FDOG) have demonstrated improved performance in noisy environments. These operators can filter out noise while revealing structural image information more clearly, even in highly noisy images  (4, Acharya et al., 2016).\n\n5. Directional smoothing: Some techniques incorporate directional smoothing to reduce noise sensitivity while preserving edge information. This can help address the lack of built-in smoothing in standard second-order operators like the Laplacian  (8, Alsirhani et al., 2022).\n\n6. Adaptive thresholding: Implementing adaptive thresholding techniques can help distinguish between genuine edges and noise-induced artifacts when using second-order operators, improving the overall robustness of edge detection in noisy conditions (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nBy employing these strategies, practitioners can leverage the benefits of second-order operators while mitigating their inherent noise sensitivity, leading to more effective signal processing and image analysis applications.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These systems aim to support developers by offering instant information about potential issues and intermediate results during the development process.\n\nReal-time feedback mechanisms are a crucial principle for designing just-in-time interventions in programming scenarios. These systems are designed to provide immediate and actionable information to developers as they write code. According to Vargas et al., next-generation real-time feedback mechanisms can effectively support the development of modern software applications by reducing execution failures  (3, Vargas et al., 2018). This can be implemented through tools such as IDE plug-ins that offer real-time feedback on software quality, helping developers create more robust programs.\n\nThe concept of live programming systems, as described by Germany et al., aims to enhance program development and comprehension by providing more direct and immediate feedback about a program's behavior  (4, Germany et al., 2019). This feedback often involves presenting developers with intermediate results and effects of the program under development, allowing for a more interactive and responsive coding experience.\n\nSamrose et al. emphasize the importance of real-time feedback in attracting user attention to problematic behavior as it occurs  (6, Samrose et al., 2020). Their system involves both server and client-side real-time data processing to ensure just-in-time feedback delivery. This approach allows developers to observe and address issues promptly, potentially leading to improved code quality and a more efficient development process.\n\nBy incorporating these real-time feedback mechanisms, just-in-time interventions in programming scenarios can provide developers with valuable insights and support throughout the coding process, potentially leading to higher quality software and a more efficient development workflow.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These interventions aim to offer relevant assistance while minimizing cognitive load and maximizing usability.\n\nContext-awareness and accessibility are crucial principles for designing effective just-in-time interventions in programming scenarios. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools have traditionally offered contextualized and easily accessible support for developers. However, as noted by Lasecki et al., these tools are often limited in their ability to provide comprehensive feedback due to their lack of true understanding of user queries or problem contexts  (2, Lasecki et al., 2016).\n\nTo address these limitations, more advanced approaches are being developed. Melo et al. propose a novel paradigm that leverages machine learning and chatbot communication to provide context-aware and real-time support for developers  (7, Melo et al., 2021). This approach aims to guide developers through various development steps, including deployment, by offering valuable information and assistance in real-time as they work on their projects.\n\nThe key advantage of context-aware interventions is their ability to adapt to the developer's current task and environment, providing relevant support when it's most needed. By incorporating accessibility features, these interventions ensure that the assistance is easily available and does not disrupt the developer's workflow. This combination of context-awareness and accessibility can potentially transform the software development process by offering more intelligent and tailored support throughout the development lifecycle  (7, Melo et al., 2021).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(2, Lasecki et al., 2016) | n_citations: 33 | Towards Providing On-Demand Expert Support for Software Developers ]: \nIDE tools provide contextualized, easily-accessible, and ondemand support for developers, but are generally limited in the types of feedback they can provide (e.g., syntax error highlighting and function auto-complete) because the system cannot truly understand user queries or the context of the problem.\n\n2. [(7, Melo et al., 2021) | n_citations: 5 | A Cognitive and Machine Learning-Based Software Development Paradigm Supported by Context ]: \nProcesses based on machine learning and communicated through a chatbot should lower the cognitive load of developers, provide context-aware and real-time support for task execution, and guide developers through the development steps such as deployment... This novel paradigm can potentially transform the way software development is currently undertaken by allowing developers to receive valuable information and guidance in realtime while they are developing their projects.\n\n\n\nCognitive Load Reduction\nTLDR: Cognitive load reduction in programming interventions aims to simplify complex tasks and provide timely support. By leveraging machine learning and chatbot communication, these interventions can offer context-aware assistance that helps developers focus on core programming tasks.\n\nReducing cognitive load is a critical principle in designing effective just-in-time interventions for programming scenarios. As software development becomes increasingly complex, tools that can alleviate the mental burden on developers are becoming essential. Melo et al. propose an innovative approach that combines machine learning and chatbot communication to provide context-aware and real-time support for developers  (7, Melo et al., 2021). This method aims to lower the cognitive load by offering timely guidance and information throughout the development process, including during deployment stages.\n\nThe key advantage of this approach is its ability to provide valuable information and guidance in real-time, allowing developers to focus on their core programming tasks without being overwhelmed by peripheral concerns or complex processes  (7, Melo et al., 2021). By automating certain aspects of decision-making and information retrieval, these interventions can potentially transform the software development workflow, making it more efficient and less mentally taxing for developers.\n\nWhile the specific implementation details and effectiveness of this approach are still being explored, the principle of cognitive load reduction through intelligent, context-aware support systems represents a promising direction for just-in-time interventions in programming scenarios (LLM MEMORY, 2024). As these systems continue to evolve, they may play an increasingly important role in supporting developers and improving overall productivity in software development projects.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This novel paradigm can potentially transform the way software development is currently undertaken by allowing developers to receive valuable information and guidance in realtime while they are developing their projects.\n\n\n\nContinuous and Proactive Support\nTLDR: Continuous and proactive support in programming scenarios offers real-time assistance without explicit invocation. This approach aims to provide timely feedback and implementation suggestions, enhancing developer productivity and code quality.\n\nContinuous and proactive support is a key principle for designing effective just-in-time interventions in programming scenarios. This approach aims to provide developers with ongoing assistance and feedback throughout the development process, without requiring explicit requests for help. Fernandes et al. highlight the importance of this principle, noting that many existing tools require developers to actively invoke them, which can lead to missed opportunities for improvement  (5, Fernandes et al., 2020). To address this issue, they propose an approach where developers receive instant and continuous feedback about their software systems, ensuring that important refactoring opportunities and other improvements are not overlooked.\n\nThe concept of Just-In-Time Programming (JITP) further emphasizes the importance of continuous and proactive support. Vidan et al. describe JITP as a user-centric approach that allows for algorithm implementation during task execution  (10, Vidan et al., 2023). This method focuses on task-oriented programming, where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate immediate implementations of algorithms, and Flow-Based Programming (FBP) orchestrates task completion in real-time. By providing this level of proactive support, JITP aims to streamline the programming process and enhance developer productivity.\n\nBy incorporating continuous and proactive support into just-in-time interventions, developers can benefit from timely assistance and guidance without interrupting their workflow. This approach can potentially lead to improved code quality, more efficient problem-solving, and a smoother overall development experience (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nReferences:\n1. [(5, Fernandes et al., 2020) | n_citations: 4 | Live Software Inspection and Refactoring ]: \nDespite existing several solutions providing feedback and suggesting improvements, many tools require explicit invocation, leading to developers missing improvement opportunities, such as important refactorings, due to lost of train of thought... we propose an approach where developers receive instant and continuous feedback about their software systems.\n\n2.

Task-oriented focus lies at the core of JITP, with LLMs generating the immediate implementation of algorithms and FBP orchestrating task completion in real-time.\n\n\n\nIntegration with Development Tools\nTLDR: Integration with development tools is crucial for effective just-in-time interventions in programming. These integrations range from IDE plugins offering real-time feedback to more advanced systems using machine learning and chatbots for contextual support.\n\n- IDE Plugins: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are a primary target for integrating just-in-time interventions. Plugins can be developed to provide real-time feedback on code quality and suggest improvements as developers write code  (3, Vargas et al., 2018). These tools can assist in creating more robust software by highlighting potential issues immediately.\n\n- Continuous Feedback Systems: Advanced integration approaches focus on providing instant and continuous feedback without requiring explicit invocation. These systems can be embedded into the development environment to offer ongoing insights about software systems, ensuring that developers don't miss important refactoring opportunities  (5, Fernandes et al., 2020).\n\n- Context-Aware Support: While traditional IDE tools offer contextualized and easily-accessible support, they are often limited in their ability to truly understand user queries or problem contexts  (2, Lasecki et al., 2016). More advanced integrations are being developed to address this limitation.\n\n- AI-Powered Assistants: Emerging integration approaches leverage machine learning and chatbot communication to provide context-aware and real-time support within the development environment. These systems aim to guide developers through various stages of development, including deployment, by offering valuable information and assistance in real-time  (7, Melo et al., 2021).\n\n- Cross-Tool Integration: To maximize effectiveness, just-in-time interventions should aim to integrate seamlessly across various development tools and platforms used in the software development lifecycle (LLM MEMORY, 2024). This ensures consistent support throughout different stages of development and across different tools.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Addressing these issues is crucial for improving the effectiveness of federated learning algorithms across diverse client datasets.\n\nFederated Learning (FL) faces a significant challenge in dealing with data heterogeneity and non-IID data distributions across participating clients  (48, He et al., 2021)  (144, Casella et al., 2023). This issue arises from the fact that in real-world scenarios, data is often not uniformly distributed among clients, leading to potential model divergence during local training and global aggregation procedures  (134, Zeng et al., 2023).\n\nThe non-IID nature of data in federated settings poses a substantial challenge to the learning accuracy of FL algorithms  (48, He et al., 2021). It can result in significant skewness across devices or locations, making it difficult to achieve a globally optimal model  (61, Liu et al., 2021). This heterogeneity not only affects the model's performance but also impacts the efficiency and convergence of the federated learning process  (12, Wu et al., 2019).\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers are focusing on developing novel approaches to reduce inconsistencies among clients with non-IID data  (134, Zeng et al., 2023). This includes improving the ability of FL algorithms to handle model divergence and proposing more effective federated optimization schemes  (2, Hong et al., 2020).\n\nIt is important to note that the design and evaluation of future FL algorithms should consider more comprehensive settings, including different non-IID data partitioning strategies and tasks  (48, He et al., 2021). This approach will help in developing more robust and effective federated learning solutions that can handle the inherent data heterogeneity in real-world applications.\n\nReferences:\n1.

There is a need to propose novel communication resource-efficient federated optimization schemes for dispersed federated learning... though federated learning has been proposed to enable privacyaware on-device machine learning in a distributed manner, it suffers from security challenges and privacy challenges.\n\n\n\nCommunication Efficiency\nTLDR: Communication efficiency is a critical challenge in federated learning due to the distributed nature of the system. Researchers are focusing on developing novel approaches to reduce communication overhead while maintaining model performance and privacy.\n\nFederated Learning (FL) systems face significant challenges in terms of communication efficiency, which is considered one of the major bottlenecks in the implementation of FL  (53, Mammen, 2021)  (63, Hasan et al., 2021). The distributed nature of FL, where devices connected over a network must constantly share updates, can create a communication bottleneck  (67, Srivastava et al., 2021). This issue is particularly pronounced in large-scale FL systems, where the communication overhead can hinder efficient collaboration between domains  (138, Li et al., 2023).\n\nThe challenge of communication efficiency is compounded by other factors inherent to FL, such as system heterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, and privacy concerns  (19, Diao et al., 2020). These factors make it crucial to develop communication resource-efficient federated optimization schemes that can operate effectively in dispersed federated learning environments  (2, Hong et al., 2020).\n\nResearchers in the field of FL are actively working on addressing this challenge. The main research directions for improving FL systems include enhancing effectiveness, efficiency, and privacy, with communication overhead being a primary focus for efficiency improvements  (12, Wu et al., 2019). Various alternatives and techniques are being evaluated to create more efficient communication strategies for federated networks  (150, Atalla et al., 2023).\n\nAs FL continues to evolve, the development of novel approaches to reduce communication overhead while maintaining model performance and privacy remains a critical area of research  (175, Shi et al., 2023). Addressing this challenge is essential for the successful implementation of FL in practice, alongside other key challenges such as systems heterogeneity, privacy, robustness, and user data heterogeneity  (13, Reisizadeh et al., 2019).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Researchers are developing advanced techniques like differential privacy and secure multi-party computation to protect user data and model integrity.\n\nFederated Learning (FL) was initially proposed as a privacy-preserving approach to distributed machine learning, but it still faces significant privacy and security challenges  (2, Hong et al., 2020)  (101, Yang et al., 2022). While FL eliminates the need for raw data transmission among parties, thus providing better privacy protection compared to traditional centralized training, it introduces new security vulnerabilities that demand attention  (159, Hasan, 2023).\n\nOne of the primary concerns in FL is the potential for data leakage, which remains an active area of research due to various factors that may compromise security  (99, Joshi et al., 2022). To address these issues, researchers are exploring several privacy-preserving methods specifically tailored for FL environments. These include secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, and privacy-preserving variants of stochastic gradient descent  (3, Prasath et al., 2022).\n\nDifferential privacy, in particular, has received significant attention in the FL context. Researchers have proposed improved differential privacy mechanisms designed for FL settings, aiming to strike a balance between strong privacy guarantees and maintaining model accuracy  (159, Hasan, 2023). These advancements are crucial for ensuring that FL systems can protect individual user data while still producing effective models.\n\nDespite these efforts, the development of robust privacy and security measures for FL remains an ongoing challenge. The distributed nature of FL, combined with the need to optimize communication resources and handle system heterogeneity, makes it particularly complex to implement comprehensive security solutions  (2, Hong et al., 2020). As FL continues to evolve and find applications in sensitive domains such as healthcare and wireless communications, addressing these privacy and security concerns will be essential for its widespread adoption and success  (3, Prasath et al., 2022).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Researchers are developing various approaches to address fairness issues, including client selection strategies, model optimization techniques, and collaborative debiasing methods.\n\nFairness has emerged as a crucial concern in federated learning (FL), with its importance growing as FL approaches maturity and wider adoption  (50, Tan et al., 2021). The distributed nature of FL, combined with data heterogeneity, can exacerbate fairness issues, making it a central challenge in deploying practical FL systems  (52, Wang et al., 2021). \n\nOne of the key difficulties in addressing fairness in FL is the need to mitigate bias without direct access to sensitive attribute values of all clients  (173, Ghosh et al., 2023). This challenge is particularly pronounced in vertical federated learning (VFL), where identifying fairness-sensitive features and performing collaborative debiasing while preserving data privacy and protocol efficiency becomes critical  (98, Kang et al., 2022).\n\nThe fairness problem in FL can occur at various stages of the training process, including client selection, model optimization, incentive distribution, and contribution evaluation  (139, Li et al., 2023). To address these issues, researchers have proposed various Fairness-Aware Federated Learning (FAFL) approaches, aiming to achieve fairness from different angles  (139, Li et al., 2023).\n\nHowever, the field faces additional challenges due to the varying definitions of fairness in the literature  (103, Huang et al., 2022). This inconsistency in fairness criteria becomes even more complex in multi-layer decentralized federated learning scenarios, where trade-offs between fairness and efficiency in multi-layer communication protocols must be considered  (132, Yuen et al., 2023).\n\nAs federated learning continues to gain traction across various interdisciplinary fields, addressing fairness concerns remains an active area of research  (1, Koyejo et al., 2019). The development of robust fairness mechanisms for FL is essential for its widespread adoption, particularly in sensitive domains where equitable outcomes are crucial (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Motivated by this growing interest, this paper discusses recent advances and presents an extensive collection of open problems and challenges.\n\n\n\nSystem Heterogeneity and Resource Constraints\nTLDR: System heterogeneity and resource constraints pose significant challenges in federated learning, particularly in IoT environments. These issues include device diversity, limited computational resources, and network instability, which can impact the efficiency and effectiveness of federated learning implementations.\n\nSystem heterogeneity and resource constraints represent major challenges in the implementation of federated learning (FL), especially in complex Internet of Things (IoT) environments  (20, Wu et al., 2020). These challenges arise from the diverse nature of participating devices and the limitations of their computational and communication resources.\n\nOne of the primary issues is device heterogeneity, which can lead to problems such as high communication costs, stragglers, and fault tolerance  (20, Wu et al., 2020). In IoT settings, this challenge is exacerbated by the presence of large numbers of FL clients, unreliable or unstable networks, and limited computing resources and memory  (160, Jadhav, 2023).\n\nThe heterogeneity in user devices and their diverse hardware capabilities can result in varying computational delays, which complicates the convergence analysis of optimization algorithms and adds more hyperparameters to consider  (55, Poor et al., 2021). This diversity in device capabilities also impacts the scheduling and resource allocation aspects of FL implementations  (24, Soner et al., 2020).\n\nCommunication-related challenges are particularly prominent in FL systems. These include transmission overhead and bottlenecks, which are further complicated by the need to preserve data privacy and the potential presence of malicious users  (55, Poor et al., 2021). Addressing these communication complexities while maintaining system efficiency is crucial for the successful deployment of FL in practice  (13, Reisizadeh et al., 2019).\n\nTo overcome these challenges, researchers are focusing on developing more efficient communication protocols, robust optimization algorithms, and adaptive resource allocation strategies that can accommodate the diverse nature of participating devices and network conditions in FL systems (LLM MEMORY, 2024). These efforts aim to make FL more practical and effective in real-world applications, particularly in resource-constrained and heterogeneous environments like IoT.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Researchers are developing novel approaches to improve model accuracy, convergence, and resource efficiency in federated settings.\n\nFederated Learning (FL) presents distinct challenges in model performance and optimization compared to traditional centralized machine learning approaches  (8, Sahu et al., 2019). The distributed nature of FL, combined with data heterogeneity across clients, necessitates innovative solutions to ensure effective model training and performance  (25, Ludwig et al., 2020).\n\nOne of the primary concerns in FL is the potential loss of model accuracy due to the aggregation process, especially when data distributions across clients are heterogeneous  (37, Torkzadehmahani et al., 2020). This non-IID (not independently and identically distributed) data scenario poses a significant challenge to the adoption of FL in large-scale applications, such as genomics and biomedicine  (37, Torkzadehmahani et al., 2020).\n\nResource allocation is another critical aspect affecting model performance in FL systems. Optimizing communication, computation, and energy efficiency is essential for improving overall system performance  (31, Wang et al., 2020). Researchers are actively working on developing more efficient communication protocols and optimization algorithms to address these resource constraints  (56, Deng et al., 2021).\n\nThe challenge of fairness across clients in FL adds another layer of complexity to model optimization  (58, Charles et al., 2021). Unlike centralized learning, FL faces fundamental limits on parallelization, which can impact the efficiency of large-cohort training  (58, Charles et al., 2021).\n\nAs the field of FL evolves, new research directions are emerging. The application of large models to decentralized FL requires novel learning paradigms and optimization approaches  (143, Thai et al., 2023). Additionally, in the context of wireless networks, further investigation is needed in areas such as model optimization, resource allocation, and network architecture to enhance the efficacy of FL  (174, Mahdimahalleh, 2023).\n\nAddressing these challenges in model performance and optimization is crucial for the widespread adoption of FL across various domains. As researchers continue to develop innovative solutions, the goal is to create more robust, efficient, and effective federated learning systems that can handle the complexities of distributed training while maintaining high model performance.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These metrics can focus on the human, the robot, or the overall system performance.\n\nMetrics for assessing the quality of human-robot communication can be classified into two main categories: objective and subjective measures  (88, Marvel et al., 2020) (129, Corrales-Paredes et al., 2023). Objective metrics provide quantitative data that can be measured directly, while subjective metrics offer qualitative or quasi-quantitative insights based on human perception and judgment.\n\nMurphy et al. propose a comprehensive framework that categorizes 42 metrics based on the object being directly measured: the human (7 metrics), the robot (6 metrics), or the system (29 metrics)  (2, Murphy et al., 2013). System metrics are further subdivided into productivity, efficiency, reliability, safety, and coactivity, providing a holistic view of the interaction quality.\n\nIn the context of evaluating dialogue managers in human-robot interaction (HRI), both subjective and objective measures can be employed  (133, Oertel et al., 2023). This dual approach allows researchers to capture both quantifiable performance indicators and user-perceived quality of the interaction.\n\nThe use of both objective and subjective metrics is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation of human-robot communication quality. Objective measures provide concrete, comparable data points, while subjective measures capture the nuanced aspects of user experience and satisfaction that may not be easily quantified (LLM MEMORY, 2024).

These metrics range from quantitative measures like dialogue quality indicators to qualitative assessments of gesture effectiveness and collaborative fluency.\n\nHuman-robot communication quality can be evaluated using a variety of metrics that focus on specific aspects of the interaction:\n\n1. Dialogue Quality Measures:\n   - Number of instruction repetitions requested by the user\n   - Failed object handovers\n   - User gaze towards the robot (frequency and duration)\n   - Robot explanations provided\n    (34, Giuliani et al., 2014)\n\n2.

Notably, research has shown that enabling robots to issue verbal commands is particularly effective in communicating objectives while maintaining user trust  (49, Nikolaidis et al., 2017).\n\nReferences:\n1.

We believe that the the same should hold for human-robot teams... Human subject experiments show that enabling the robot to issue verbal commands is the most effective form of communicating objectives, while retaining user trust in the robot.\n\n\n\nInteraction Quality Metrics\nTLDR: Interaction quality metrics in human-robot communication encompass both objective and subjective measures, focusing on engagement, satisfaction, and performance. These metrics evaluate various aspects of the interaction, including nonverbal behaviors, trust, and collaborative fluency.\n\nAssessing the quality of human-robot interaction (HRI) involves a multifaceted approach that combines objective measurements with subjective evaluations. Mayima et al. define the Quality of Interaction (QoI) as a measure indicating the effectiveness of interaction during human-robot collaborative activities, focusing on objective metrics to quantify how well the interaction progresses  (3, Mayima et al., 2021). This approach is complemented by subjective assessments that capture the human perspective on the interaction.\n\nSubjective evaluations often involve questionnaires that probe various aspects of the interaction. Common themes in these assessments include the fluency of the interaction, perceived safety and comfort, user satisfaction, ease of use of the interface, robot competence, timing appropriateness, perceived aggressiveness, trust in the robot, and the robot's human-likeness  (86, Ortenzi et al., 2020). Additionally, Murali et al. highlight the importance of evaluating trust, robot performance, team fluency, mental effort during collaboration, and comfort levels when working in close proximity with the robot  (91, Murali et al., 2020).\n\nObjective measures often focus on nonverbal behaviors during human-robot interactions. Ivaldi et al. propose a methodology that analyzes these nonverbal cues to determine the effectiveness of different robot behaviors in improving interaction quality  (37, Ivaldi et al., 2015). Ishiguro suggests that subconscious reactions, such as eye movements and posture synchronization, can be measured and analyzed to provide insights into the interaction quality  (10, Ishiguro, 2006).\n\nRecent research has attempted to identify the factors that humans prioritize when evaluating HRI quality. Tanno et al. conducted a factor analysis to uncover underlying evaluation metrics based on open-ended responses from evaluators  (4, Tanno et al., 2023). This approach helps in understanding the human perspective on interaction quality and can inform the development of more comprehensive evaluation frameworks.\n\nSome researchers have proposed models and metrics specifically targeting the evaluation of QoI in collaborative tasks. Mayima et al. introduced a set of metrics that measure human engagement and online task effectiveness, showing significant differences in computed QoI when interacting with fully compliant, confused, or non-cooperative humans  (100, Mayima et al., 2020).\n\nCross et al. emphasize the importance of assessing participants' perceptions of the robot's communication competency and overall interaction quality  (118, Cross et al., 2022). This approach helps in understanding how humans perceive and experience the interaction, which is crucial for designing more effective human-robot communication systems.\n\nWagner et al. introduce a framework that measures satisfaction working with the robot, perception of dyad performance (effectiveness), and the desire to work with the robot again (viability)  (136, Wagner et al., 2023). Their study revealed that the robot's interaction modality (gesture or pointing) significantly affected participants' satisfaction and perception of dyad performance, highlighting the importance of considering different interaction modes when evaluating HRI quality.\n\nIn conclusion, interaction quality metrics in human-robot communication encompass a wide range of objective and subjective measures. These metrics aim to capture the nuanced aspects of human-robot interactions, from nonverbal behaviors and engagement to satisfaction and collaborative performance, providing a comprehensive assessment of the communication quality between humans and robots.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(86, Ortenzi et al., 2020) | n_citations: 87 | Object Handovers: A Review for Robotics ]: \nThe most commonly asked questions in the questionnaires relate to the fluency of the interaction... how safe and comfortable the participants felt during the interaction, whether participants were satisfied with the experience, the ease of use of the interface, the competence of the robot, the appropriateness of the robot's timing, the perceived aggressiveness of the robot, the trust in the robot, and whether the robot acted in a human-like manner.\n\n3.

The results showed that there was a significant effect of the robot type, either a gesture or pointing interaction modality, on participants' satisfaction working with the robot, and their perception of dyad performance.\n\n\n\nCollaborative Fluency Metrics\nTLDR: Collaborative fluency metrics assess the coordination and synchronization between humans and robots during joint tasks. These metrics include both objective measures like concurrent motion and resource delay, as well as subjective evaluations of the robot's helpfulness and interaction naturalness.\n\nCollaborative fluency metrics are essential for evaluating the quality of human-robot teamwork and interaction. These metrics aim to quantify the coordinated meshing of joint activities between humans and robots in shared-location tasks  (72, Hoffman, 2019). The following list outlines key collaborative fluency metrics used in human-robot interaction research:\n\n1. Objective Metrics:\n   - Concurrent motion: Measures the simultaneous movement of both human and robot\n   - Zero motion: Assesses periods when neither the human nor the robot is moving\n   - Human idle time (H-IDLE) and Robot idle time (R-IDLE): Quantifies periods of inactivity for each agent\n   - Human-only movement time: Measures duration when only the human is active\n   - Robot-only movement time: Measures duration when only the robot is active\n    (72, Hoffman, 2019)\n\n2. Subjective Metrics:\n   - Robot's helpfulness: Human perception of the robot's assistance\n   - Robot's awareness of human and task progress: Evaluation of the robot's situational understanding\n   - Robot's contribution to the task: Assessment of the robot's role in task completion\n   - Overall fluency: General perception of the interaction's smoothness\n   - Efficiency: Evaluation of task performance\n   - Naturalness of the interaction: Human judgment of how natural the collaboration feels\n    (72, Hoffman, 2019)\n\n3. Resource Delay: Measures the time delay in resource utilization during collaboration\n    (80, Rice et al., 2019)\n\n4. Concurrent Inactivity: Assesses periods when both human and robot are simultaneously inactive\n    (80, Rice et al., 2019)\n\n5. Turn-taking efficiency: Evaluates the smoothness of transitions between human and robot actions\n   (96, Kuli\u0107 et al., 2020)\n\n6. Motion fluency: Assesses the smoothness and naturalness of robot movements\n    (103, Santos et al., 2021)\n\n7. Seamlessness with human motions: Evaluates how well robot movements integrate with human actions\n    (103, Santos et al., 2021)\n\n8. Coordination with operator movements: Measures the synchronization between human and robot actions\n    (103, Santos et al., 2021)\n\n9. Adaptive motion: Assesses the robot's ability to adjust its movements based on human actions\n    (103, Santos et al., 2021)\n\n10. Success in object handovers: Evaluates the effectiveness of both giving and receiving objects between human and robot\n     (103, Santos et al., 2021)\n\nThese collaborative fluency metrics provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the quality of human-robot communication and teamwork. By combining objective measurements with subjective evaluations, researchers can gain insights into both the quantitative performance and the perceived quality of human-robot interactions  (113, Gasparetto et al., 2022).\n\nReferences:\n1.

These frameworks often combine objective performance measures with subjective user satisfaction assessments.\n\nSeveral evaluation frameworks and models have been proposed to assess the quality of human-robot communication, each focusing on different aspects of the interaction. Scheutz et al. present a comprehensive framework that organizes metrics into four stages of proficiency-based human-robot interactions: robot self-assessment, robot communication of proficiency, human understanding, and robot perception of human intentions  (115, Scheutz et al., 2022). This approach provides a structured way to evaluate the entire communication process.\n\nFor dialogue systems, the PARADISE (PARAdigm for DIalogue System Evaluation) framework is widely used. It combines subjective user satisfaction metrics with objective measures of dialogue efficiency, quality, and task success  (127, Chen et al., 2023). This framework allows for a holistic evaluation of spoken dialogue agents, balancing user experience with system performance.\n\nThe Virtual Assistant, Human, and Robots in the loop (VAHR) system offers another evaluation approach, comparing traditional interfaces with voice-based systems. VAHR demonstrated significant improvements in Robot Attention Demand and Fan-out time, indicating enhanced multitasking capabilities  (135, Hasan et al., 2023). This system highlights the potential benefits of integrating virtual assistants in human-robot communication.\n\nSome researchers have proposed specific metrics for evaluating communication efficiency. Wollowski et al. define human-robot communication efficiency as a ratio of task efficiency to communication effort, considering both natural language and gesturing efforts  (56, Wollowski et al., 2017). This metric provides a quantitative measure of the overall communication effectiveness.\n\nPardo et al. categorize HRI evaluation methods into five main types: self-assessment, behavioral observation, psychophysiology measures, interviews, and task performance metrics  (44, Pardo et al., 2015). This classification offers a comprehensive toolkit for researchers to choose appropriate evaluation methods based on their specific study requirements.\n\nFor conversational agents, Casati et al. propose evaluating quality based on user engagement, task completion, conversation quality (including consistency and memory), and human-like communication  (70, Casati et al., 2018). These metrics focus on the nuanced aspects of dialogue-based interactions, which are increasingly important in human-robot communication.\n\nIn conclusion, these frameworks and models provide a diverse set of tools for evaluating human-robot communication quality. They range from comprehensive stage-based approaches to specific metrics for dialogue systems and virtual assistants, often combining objective performance measures with subjective user assessments to provide a well-rounded evaluation of the interaction quality.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This theorem ensures that all relevant frequency components of the signal are captured during sampling.\n\nThe Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem provides a fundamental guideline for determining the maximum allowable sampling period when designing a Kalman filter. According to this theorem, to accurately capture the information in a time series with a minimum period \u03c4e, the sampling intervals (Ts) must be less than half of this minimum period  (4, Cabella et al., 2014). Mathematically, this is expressed as Ts < (\u03c4e/2). This upper bound on the sampling period ensures that all relevant frequency components of the signal are captured during the sampling process, avoiding aliasing effects that could lead to misinterpretation of the data or poor filter performance.\n\n(LLM MEMORY, 2024) It's important to note that while adhering to this theorem prevents information loss due to undersampling, it does not guarantee optimal filter performance. Other factors, such as computational resources and system dynamics, may influence the choice of sampling period within this upper bound. The Nyquist-Shannon theorem provides a crucial starting point for determining an appropriate sampling rate, but practical considerations often lead to sampling at rates higher than this minimum requirement to improve estimation accuracy and robustness.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(4, Cabella et al., 2014) | n_citations: 0 | Could sampling make hares eat lynxes ]: \nThis effect can be avoided considering the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, which states that given a time series with minimum period \u03c4 e , the equally spaced intervals between samples T s must be smaller than half the minimum period, i.e., T s < (\u03c4 e /2).\n\n\n\nLower bound considerations for sampling period\nTLDR: While the Nyquist-Shannon theorem sets an upper bound, there are also reasons to consider a lower bound for the sampling period in Kalman filter design. Extremely short sampling periods can lead to computational inefficiencies and potential degradation of filter performance.\n\nWhile the Nyquist-Shannon theorem establishes an upper bound for the sampling period, there are important considerations for setting a lower bound as well. One key factor is the relationship between the sampling period and the dynamics of the system being estimated. Chen et al. point out that excessively short sampling periods can lead to computational inefficiencies without necessarily improving filter performance  (6, Chen et al., 2016). \n\nMoreover, the choice of sampling period can significantly impact the filter's ability to handle noise and maintain stability. Karameh et al. demonstrate that in the context of continuous-discrete cubature Kalman filters (CD-CKF), very short sampling intervals relative to the system dynamics can actually lead to a marginal deterioration in performance when estimating hidden dynamics  (7, Karameh et al., 2017). This suggests that there may be an optimal range for the sampling period that balances the need for accurate state estimation with the filter's ability to effectively integrate and process noise within the continuous dynamics.\n\nIt's important to note that the optimal sampling period may vary depending on the specific application and the characteristics of the system being observed (LLM MEMORY, 2024). Factors such as the system's time constants, the nature of the noise present, and the computational resources available all play a role in determining the most suitable sampling period within the bounds set by theoretical considerations and practical limitations.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(6, Chen et al., 2016) | n_citations: 25 | Autonomous orbit determination via kalman filtering of gravity gradients ]: \nHowever, an extremely large sampling period will cause divergence of the filter, since the state prediction error is positively correlated with the sampling period and might exceeds the linear correction range of the EKF.\n\n2. [(7, Karameh et al., 2017) | n_citations: 4 | Hybrid Cubature Kalman filtering for identifying nonlinear models from sampled recording: Estimation of neuronal dynamics ]: \nOn the other hand, and because the CD-CKF integrates the impact of noise within the continuous dynamics during the time-update (prediction) step, the filter performance deteriorates marginally in estimating the hidden dynamics for sampling intervals that are quite large (dt = 4-8 ms) in relation to the speed of such dynamics (membrane time constant~20 ms).\n\n\n\nEffects of sampling period on filter performance\nTLDR: The sampling period significantly impacts Kalman filter performance, affecting both accuracy and stability. While very short sampling periods can lead to computational inefficiency, excessively long periods may cause filter divergence or deterioration in estimating system dynamics.\n\nThe choice of sampling period in Kalman filter design involves a delicate balance between accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency. Chen et al. highlight a critical upper limit to the sampling period, noting that excessively large intervals can lead to filter divergence  (6, Chen et al., 2016). This occurs because the state prediction error grows with the sampling period, potentially exceeding the linear correction range of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Consequently, while a longer sampling period might seem computationally advantageous, it can compromise the filter's ability to accurately track the system state.\n\nOn the other hand, Karameh et al. demonstrate that very short sampling intervals can also be problematic, particularly in the context of continuous-discrete cubature Kalman filters (CD-CKF)  (7, Karameh et al., 2017). Their research shows that when sampling intervals are quite small relative to the system's dynamics (e.g., 4-8 ms for a system with a ~20 ms time constant), the filter's performance in estimating hidden dynamics can marginally deteriorate. This counter-intuitive result stems from the CD-CKF's integration of noise impact within the continuous dynamics during the prediction step.\n\nThese findings suggest that an optimal sampling period likely exists between the upper and lower bounds, balancing the need for accurate state estimation with computational efficiency and the filter's ability to effectively handle system dynamics and noise. The specific optimal value would depend on the particular system characteristics, noise properties, and computational constraints of the application at hand (LLM MEMORY, 2024).\n\nReferences:\n1.

This challenge necessitates careful consideration of when to apply prediction and correction phases in the filter's operation.\n\nWhile the implementation of discrete-time Kalman filters is straightforward with periodic sampling, real-world applications often involve irregular sampling intervals, which introduces significant challenges. Lozoya et al. highlight that adapting the standard Kalman filter to accommodate irregular sampling is a notable problem in filter design  (2, Lozoya et al., 2010). The main issue lies in determining the appropriate timing for applying the prediction and correction phases of the filter when sampling is not uniform.\n\nThis challenge is particularly relevant when considering the optimal sampling period discussion from previous sections. In practical scenarios, maintaining a strictly periodic sampling rate may not always be feasible due to various factors such as sensor limitations, communication delays, or resource constraints. As a result, the filter must be robust enough to handle varying time intervals between measurements while still maintaining accuracy and stability in state estimation (LLM MEMORY, 2024). Addressing irregular sampling in Kalman filter design requires more sophisticated algorithms that can dynamically adjust the filter's parameters based on the actual sampling times, potentially increasing computational complexity but offering greater flexibility in real-world applications.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(2, Lozoya et al., 2010) | n_citations: 1 | Embedding Kalman techniques in the one-shot task model when non-uniform samples are corrupted by noise ]: \nThe implementation of a discrete-time Kalman filter is straightforward if strictly periodic sampling is ensured... This poses the problem of adapting the standard Kalman filter to the case of irregular sampling, and decide when to apply the prediction and the correction phase.\n\n\n\n"}

The trade-offs often involve computational complexity, scalability, and similarity to real-world problems.\n\nThe various methods for generating hard SAT instances each come with their own set of strengths and weaknesses:\n\n1. Graph-based methods: These approaches, such as those using high-girth bipartite incidence graphs (29, Ans\u00f3tegui et al., 2008) and digraph-based generators (57, Bir\u00f3 et al., 2020), can produce instances that are particularly challenging for certain types of SAT solvers. For example, minimal unsatisfiable SAT instances generated from strong digraphs are considered among the hardest unsatisfiable clause sets (57, Bir\u00f3 et al., 2020). However, these methods may be computationally expensive to generate large instances.\n\n2. Probability distribution methods: Geometrical and geo-regular generators aim to create instances more similar to industrial problems (30, Ans\u00f3tegui et al., 2008). The 0-hidden algorithm offers fine-grained control over instance hardness against local search strategies  (70, Jiang et al., 2023). However, these methods may not always produce consistently hard instances across all solver types.\n\n3. Transformation-based methods: Approaches like the W2SAT framework learn from real-world instances to generate SAT formulas  (71, Yu et al., 2023). This can lead to more realistic benchmarks, but the quality of the generated instances depends heavily on the input data and learning process.\n\n4. Specialized algorithms: Methods like No-Triangle SAT (53, O'Sullivan et al., 2019) and frustrated-loop inspired generators  (54, Ventra et al., 2019) can produce hard instances for specific problem types. However, their applicability may be limited to certain classes of SAT problems.\n\n5. XOR-SAT instances: These are known to be among the hardest benchmarks for many satisfiability solvers, especially those that don't exploit the problem's linearity (28, Zdeborov'a, 2008). However, this very specific structure may not represent the full spectrum of SAT problem types.\n\nA significant challenge in generating hard SAT instances is that many state-of-the-art solvers are designed to quickly focus on specific portions of the search space they handle best  (1, Kautz et al., 0). This adaptability of modern solvers makes it difficult to consistently generate instances that are universally hard.\n\nTraditional random k-SAT generators often struggle to produce consistently hard satisfiable instances  (8, Cayrol et al., 1997). This limitation has driven the development of more sophisticated generation methods.\n\nRecent work has focused on capturing multiple graph statistics exhibited by real-world SAT formulas  (50, Barrett et al., 2019), aiming to create more realistic and challenging benchmarks. However, fully replicating the complexity of industrial instances remains an open challenge.\n\nIn summary, while various methods excel at generating hard instances for specific solver types or problem classes, creating universally hard instances that closely mimic real-world problems remains a significant challenge in the field.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These characteristics include being close to the satisfiability threshold, having high resolution width, and possessing certain graph-theoretic properties.\n\nHard SAT instances are characterized by several key properties that contribute to their difficulty for solving algorithms:\n\n1. Proximity to the satisfiability threshold: Hard instances often lie near the phase transition point where the probability of satisfiability changes sharply  (5, Mitchell et al., 1997). This region typically produces instances that are particularly challenging for SAT solvers.\n\n2. High resolution width: Instances with high resolution width, such as those based on high-girth bipartite incidence graphs, can be extremely difficult for resolution-based SAT solvers (25, J\u00a8arvisalo et al., 2006).\n\n3. Graph-theoretic properties: SAT instances derived from certain graph structures, like Eulerian graphs, can pose significant challenges for resolution-based solvers  (26, Markstrom, 2006). These instances exploit the limitations of common solving techniques.\n\n4. Single-solution instances: Surprisingly, random 3-SAT instances with exactly one solution can be harder to solve than those from the phase transition region, especially as problem size increases  (24, Znidaric, 2005). This challenges the conventional wisdom about instance difficulty.\n\n5. Balanced clause-to-variable ratio: Hard instances often have a specific ratio of clauses to variables that maximizes difficulty  (3, Mitchell et al., 1996). This ratio varies depending on the specific type of SAT problem (e.g., 3-SAT vs. k-SAT).\n\n6. Structural properties mimicking real-world instances: Hard instances that capture multiple graph statistics exhibited by real-world SAT formulas can be particularly challenging, as they combine theoretical hardness with practical relevance [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nUnderstanding these characteristics is crucial for both generating effective benchmark instances and developing more robust SAT solving algorithms. The interplay between these properties and different solving strategies continues to be an active area of research in the SAT community.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The development of effective testing methodologies is crucial for advancing SAT solving algorithms and understanding their strengths and limitations.\n\nThe evaluation and testing of SAT solvers is a critical aspect of advancing the field of Boolean satisfiability problem solving. This process involves several key components:\n\n1. Benchmark Instance Generation: Creating effective benchmark instances is crucial for evaluating SAT solvers. Hard instances are particularly valuable as they challenge solvers and help identify their limitations  (5, Mitchell et al., 1997). However, generating consistently hard instances has proven challenging, as modern solvers quickly adapt to focus on specific portions of the search space they handle best  (1, Kautz et al., 0).\n\n2. Performance Metrics: SAT solver evaluation typically considers factors such as runtime, memory usage, and the ability to find solutions or prove unsatisfiability. For Max-SAT problems, the quality of solutions found is also a key metric  (40, Layeb, 2012).\n\n3. Algorithm Comparison: Evaluations often compare different solving strategies, such as local search methods (e.g., GSAT, Tabu Search) and more advanced techniques like Belief Propagation Guided Decimation  (40, Layeb, 2012) (46, Coja-Oghlan, 2017).\n\n4. Theoretical Bounds: Evaluations may consider known theoretical bounds for certain classes of algorithms, helping to contextualize empirical results  (5, Mitchell et al., 1997).\n\n5. Real-world Applicability: As SAT can model many combinatorial optimization problems, evaluating solvers on instances that reflect real-world scenarios is important for assessing practical utility  (38, Bouhmala et al., 2011).\n\n6. Scalability Testing: Evaluations often explore how solver performance changes with increasing problem size, particularly near critical thresholds where problems transition from typically satisfiable to typically unsatisfiable (46, Coja-Oghlan, 2017).\n\n7. Continuous Improvement: The development of hard instance generators and robust evaluation methodologies is an ongoing process, driven by the need to keep pace with advancing solver capabilities (17, V\u00c1ZQUEZ-MOR\u00c1N et al., 2002).\n\nBy rigorously evaluating and testing SAT solvers using these methods, researchers can identify strengths and weaknesses in current algorithms, guide future development efforts, and ultimately advance the state of the art in SAT solving.\n\nReferences:\n1.

{"case_id": "a006865cdd1db1cfc34bfbec067d47e4", "answer_text": "Definition of Unique k-SAT\nTLDR: Unique k-SAT is a special case of the k-SAT problem where a formula has at most one satisfying assignment. It is considered to be as difficult as general k-SAT, with tight relationships between their time complexities.\n\nUnique k-SAT is a variant of the well-known k-SAT problem in computational complexity theory. It is defined as the \"promised version\" of k-SAT where the given formula is guaranteed to have either zero or exactly one satisfying assignment  (35, Xu et al., 2020). This constraint on the number of solutions distinguishes Unique k-SAT from the general k-SAT problem, which may have multiple satisfying assignments.\n\nDespite its more restricted nature, Unique k-SAT is not necessarily easier to solve than general k-SAT. In fact, it has been proven to be as difficult as the general k-SAT problem  (35, Xu et al., 2020). This equivalence in difficulty is further supported by recent research showing a tight relationship between the time complexities of Unique k-SAT and k-SAT  (37, Vyas et al., 2020).\n\nThe significance of Unique k-SAT lies in its potential to provide insights into the nature of satisfiability problems and their computational complexity. By studying this more constrained version of k-SAT, researchers can potentially develop new algorithmic approaches or theoretical bounds that might be applicable to the general case or other related problems in computational complexity theory [LLM MEMORY | 2024].\n\nReferences:\n1. [(35, Xu et al., 2020) | n_citations: 2 | Uniquely Satisfiable d-Regular (k,s)-SAT Instances ]: \nUnique k-SAT is the promised version of k-SAT where the given formula has 0 or 1 solution and is proved to be as difficult as the general k-SAT. For any k\u22653, s\u2265f(k,d) and (s+d)/2>k\u22121, a parsimonious reduction from k-CNF to d-regular (k,s)-CNF is given.\n\n2. [(37, Vyas et al., 2020) | n_citations: 0 | Results on a Super Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis ]: \nThe Unique k-SAT problem is the special case where there is at most one satisfying assignment... Improving prior reductions, we show the time complexities of Unique k-SAT and k-SAT are very tightly related: if Unique k-SAT is in 2n(1\u2212f(k)/k) time for an unbounded f, then k-SAT is in 2n(1\u2212f(k)(1\u2212\u025b)/k) time for every \u025b > 0.\n\n\n\nTheoretical Results for Unique k-SAT\nTLDR: Unique k-SAT, like general k-SAT, is NP-complete for k \u2265 3 and exhibits a satisfiability threshold. Theoretical results include complexity bounds, connections to statistical physics, and relationships with random k-SAT models.\n\nUnique k-SAT shares many theoretical properties with general k-SAT, including its computational complexity and phase transition behavior. For k \u2265 3, Unique k-SAT is NP-complete, making it intractable to solve efficiently in the worst case  (14, Tardos et al., 2010). This complexity extends to the counting problem of determining the number of satisfying assignments, which is #P-complete for k-SAT  (13, Montanari et al., 2010).\n\nA central focus of theoretical research on k-SAT problems, including Unique k-SAT, is the study of random instances and their phase transitions. The random k-SAT model is particularly important for understanding the average-case complexity and serving as a benchmark for satisfiability algorithms  (27, Pankratov et al., 2017). A key concept in this area is the satisfiability threshold, denoted as \u03b1_c(k) or \u03b1_sat, which marks the critical clause-to-variable ratio beyond which a random k-SAT formula becomes unsatisfiable with high probability as the number of variables approaches infinity  (6, Shah et al., 2006)  (22, Ding et al., 2014).\n\nFor large k, the satisfiability threshold has been rigorously characterized as \u03b1_sat = 2^k ln(2) - \u0398(1)  (31, Vyas et al., 2019). This threshold behavior is crucial for understanding the difficulty of solving random k-SAT instances, with formulas near the threshold often being the hardest to solve (21, \u5468 et al., 2013).\n\nThe study of Unique k-SAT has also revealed interesting connections to statistical physics. Concepts such as replica symmetry breaking and the proliferation of metastable states have been applied to analyze random k-SAT problems  (4, Zhou, 2004). These connections provide valuable insights into the structure and complexity of satisfiability problems.\n\nRegarding algorithmic performance, the best-known algorithms for Unique k-SAT have similar running time bounds to those for general k-SAT, scaling as 2^(n(1-O(1/k)))  (31, Vyas et al., 2019). This suggests that the uniqueness constraint does not significantly simplify the problem from a worst-case complexity perspective.\n\nSeveral open questions and conjectures continue to drive research in this area. Feige's hypothesis posits that for sufficiently high clause-to-variable ratios, random k-SAT cannot be refuted in polynomial time  (29, Vyas, 2018). Additionally, the \"Super-Strong ETH\" hypothesis suggests that worst-case k-SAT cannot be solved in time 2^(n(1-\u03c9_k(1)/k))  (29, Vyas, 2018).\n\nThese theoretical results collectively paint a picture of Unique k-SAT as a problem that, despite its more constrained nature, retains much of the complexity and rich structure of general k-SAT. The ongoing research in this area continues to deepen our understanding of satisfiability problems and their computational challenges.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(29, Vyas, 2018) | n_citations: 1 | Super Strong ETH is False for Random k-SAT ]: \nFeige's hypothesis for $k$-SAT says that for all sufficiently large clause-to-variable ratios, random $k$-SAT cannot be refuted in polynomial time. It has also been hypothesized that the worst-case $k$-SAT problem cannot be solved in $2^{n(1-\\omega_k(1)/k)}$ time... This hypothesis has been called the \"Super-Strong ETH\", modeled after the ETH and the Strong ETH.\n\n\n\nRelationship between Unique k-SAT and general k-SAT\nTLDR: Unique k-SAT and general k-SAT are closely related in terms of algorithmic performance and complexity. Improvements in solving Unique k-SAT often lead to advancements in general k-SAT algorithms, with their time complexities being tightly linked.\n\nThe relationship between Unique k-SAT and general k-SAT is characterized by a strong algorithmic and complexity-theoretic connection. One of the most significant links between these problems is exemplified by the PPSZ algorithm, which was initially designed for Unique k-SAT but has proven to be equally effective for general k-SAT instances  (17, Hertli, 2011). This algorithm demonstrates that advances in solving Unique k-SAT can directly translate to improvements in general k-SAT solving techniques  (28, Scheder et al., 2017).\n\nRecent research has further solidified the tight relationship between the time complexities of Unique k-SAT and k-SAT. Vyas et al. showed that if Unique k-SAT can be solved in 2^n(1\u2212f(k)/k) time for an unbounded function f, then k-SAT can be solved in 2^n(1\u2212f(k)(1\u2212\u025b)/k) time for every \u025b > 0  (37, Vyas et al., 2020). This result suggests that any significant improvement in solving Unique k-SAT would lead to a corresponding improvement in general k-SAT, albeit with a slight loss in the exponent.\n\nThe similarity in complexity is also reflected in the best-known algorithmic performance for both problems. Currently, algorithms for both Unique k-SAT and general k-SAT exhibit a running time behavior of 2^n(1-O(1/k))  (31, Vyas et al., 2019). This parallel in performance underscores the intrinsic difficulty of Unique k-SAT, despite its more constrained nature.\n\nThese findings collectively indicate that Unique k-SAT serves as a valuable proxy for studying general k-SAT. The uniqueness constraint, while seemingly restrictive, does not appear to significantly simplify the problem from a worst-case complexity perspective. Instead, it offers a potentially cleaner analytical framework for developing and understanding satisfiability algorithms, with insights and improvements often generalizing to the broader k-SAT domain.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Common metrics include intra-list distance, category coverage, entropy, and Gini index, which assess different aspects of diversity in recommendation lists.\n\nDiversity in recommendation systems is typically evaluated using a range of metrics that capture different aspects of recommendation variety and distribution. These metrics can be broadly categorized into individual-level and aggregate-level diversity measures:\n\n1. Intra-List Distance (ILD): Measures the dissimilarity between items in a recommendation list  (114, Yin et al., 2021)  (142, Peng et al., 2023).\n\n2.

Researchers often analyze the trade-off between these two aspects, aiming to achieve a balance that improves overall recommendation quality and user satisfaction.\n\nThe evaluation of new methods that optimize diversity in recommendation systems commonly involves a multi-faceted approach that considers both accuracy and diversity metrics. This approach recognizes the inherent trade-off between these two aspects and seeks to find an optimal balance  (2, Bellini et al., 2017)  (89, Raza et al., 2020).\n\nResearchers typically employ a combination of metrics to assess recommendation performance. Accuracy metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE), and F-Measure are often used alongside diversity metrics to provide a comprehensive evaluation  (77, Wang et al., 2019). Common diversity metrics include coverage, personality, and those mentioned in the previous section  (103, Liu et al., 2020)  (65, Li et al., 2018).\n\nThe evaluation process often involves comparing the proposed diversity-optimizing method against baseline algorithms and state-of-the-art approaches. This comparison helps to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method in terms of both accuracy and diversity  (111, Ren et al., 2021)  (94, Ho et al., 2020). Some studies explicitly quantify the trade-off between different metrics, such as accuracy-coverage, accuracy-diversity, and accuracy-serendipity  (89, Raza et al., 2020).\n\nRecent approaches in diversity optimization aim to consider diversity directly when generating recommendations, developing more sophisticated models to achieve a better accuracy-diversity trade-off  (127, Laporte et al., 2021). These methods often demonstrate improvements in terms of the accuracy-diversity balance compared to traditional diversity enhancement techniques  (132, Gao et al., 2022).\n\nEvaluation is not limited to offline metrics alone. Some researchers conduct online A/B tests to demonstrate the real-world impact of their diversity-optimizing methods on both accuracy and diversity in live recommender systems  (99, Liu et al., 2020). Additionally, user studies are sometimes employed to assess how diversity improvements affect overall user satisfaction with recommendation lists, recognizing that quantitative metrics alone may not fully capture the user experience  (132, Gao et al., 2022).\n\nIn summary, the evaluation of new diversity-optimizing methods in recommendation systems typically involves a comprehensive assessment of both accuracy and diversity metrics, with a focus on understanding and optimizing the trade-off between these two crucial aspects of recommendation quality.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These assessments aim to measure the impact of diverse recommendations on user satisfaction, acceptance, and overall experience.\n\nThe evaluation of diversity-optimizing methods in recommendation systems has evolved to incorporate user-centric metrics and real-world user studies, recognizing that quantitative metrics alone may not fully capture the user experience. This approach aims to assess the impact of diverse recommendations on user satisfaction, acceptance, and overall experience with the system.\n\nUser-centric evaluations often involve conducting experiments with actual users of recommendation services. For instance, Nakajima et al. conducted user experiments to investigate the effect of recommendation algorithms specialized in increasing diversity, demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed system in diversifying recommendation lists and its impact on user experience  (156, Nakajima et al., 2024). Similarly, Wang et al. performed a real-time study to compare user satisfaction and acceptance with respect to diversified recommendations, providing insights into how users perceive and interact with more diverse content  (77, Wang et al., 2019).\n\nThe importance of user-centric metrics in evaluating recommendation diversity has been highlighted by several researchers. McNee et al. emphasized the significance of metrics that gauge different aspects of recommendation list quality, including content diversity  (101, Noordeh et al., 2020). This approach recognizes that diversity is a key factor in fulfilling user satisfaction  (144, Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nSome studies focus on modeling users' inclination towards selecting diverse items. Sciascio et al. proposed an approach to model users' diversity preferences based on content-based item attributes, with experimental evaluations proving the effectiveness of their method  (26, Sciascio et al., 2014). This type of research helps in tailoring diversity optimization to individual user preferences, potentially leading to more satisfying recommendations.\n\nIn addition to offline evaluations, online A/B tests are sometimes employed to assess the real-world impact of diversity-optimizing methods. Wang et al. conducted both offline and online evaluations to verify the significance of objective-level personalization in multi-objective recommendation scenarios  (113, Wang et al., 2021). These types of evaluations provide valuable insights into how diversity improvements affect user behavior and satisfaction in live recommendation systems.\n\nBy incorporating user satisfaction and experience assessments, researchers and practitioners can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how diversity-optimizing methods impact the overall quality and effectiveness of recommendation systems from the user's perspective.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These approaches leverage various sensor data and robot interactions to build robust traversability models.\n\nSelf-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for robots to autonomously learn terrain traversability costs from their own experiences. This method eliminates the need for manual labeling and allows robots to adapt to new environments more efficiently.\n\nOne notable example is the STERLING system, which learns terrain representations from unconstrained, unlabeled robot experiences  (14, Stone et al., 2023). STERLING uses self-supervised learning techniques to develop terrain representations and traversability costs, making it particularly relevant for autonomous navigation in unknown environments.\n\nCastro et al. proposed a method that combines exteroceptive environmental information with proprioceptive terrain interaction feedback to predict traversability costmaps in a self-supervised manner  (9, Castro et al., 2022). This approach has been validated on multiple large-scale navigation tasks using different all-terrain robots, demonstrating its effectiveness in challenging off-road terrains.\n\nA foundational work in this area is by Kim et al., who developed an online learning method for predicting traversability properties of complex terrain  (1, Kim et al., 2006). Their approach is based on the concept that traversability is an affordance jointly determined by the vehicle and its environment. By exploiting the robot's navigation experiences, they train classifiers without human intervention, making the system highly adaptable.\n\nRecent advancements include the use of kinodynamic models to estimate traction for rolling robots. Velasquez et al. introduced a self-supervised method that uses traction estimates from an online receding horizon estimator to train a traversability prediction neural network  (159, Velasquez et al., 2022). This approach eliminates the need for heuristics used in previous methods.\n\nAnother innovative approach is the BADGR system, which uses self-supervised offline reinforcement learning for mobile robot navigation  (160, Li et al., 2022). This system allows the network to learn traversability information directly from the robot's motion events, further enhancing its ability to adapt to new terrains.\n\nThese self-supervised learning approaches represent a significant advancement in enabling robots to autonomously learn and adapt to various terrain conditions, reducing the need for extensive pre-training or human intervention.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[33] designed a self-supervised offline reinforcement learning-based mobile robot navigation system called BADGR, allowing the network to learn traversability information from the robot's motion events.\n\n\n\nReinforcement Learning and Inverse Reinforcement Learning Methods\nTLDR: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods are being applied to learn terrain traversability costs from robot experiences and human demonstrations. These approaches enable robots to adapt to complex terrains and mimic specific navigation styles.\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL) and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) have emerged as powerful techniques for learning terrain traversability costs in robotics. These methods offer the advantage of learning directly from robot experiences or human demonstrations, allowing for more adaptive and nuanced navigation strategies.\n\nIRL has gained significant attention for modeling terrain traversability, particularly in autonomous vehicles  (11, Grizzle et al., 2022). Unlike traditional approaches that use predefined metrics, IRL aims to learn traversability costs directly from a robot's traversing behaviors. This method allows for a more flexible and context-aware understanding of terrain challenges.\n\nHuman demonstrations have been leveraged effectively in IRL approaches. Wigness et al. used maximum entropy IRL to learn local costmaps that enable robots to mimic specific human navigation styles  (93, Liu et al., 2020)  (97, Stone et al., 2020). For example, robots can be trained to maintain proximity to grass while traversing only road terrain, or to navigate covertly by staying close to building edges.\n\nIn the realm of RL, various algorithms have been applied to robot navigation on uneven terrains. Deterministic policies such as DDPG, A3C, and DQN with dense rewards have been incorporated for this purpose  (149, Chakraborty et al., 2022). These methods allow robots to learn optimal navigation strategies through trial and error in simulated or real environments.\n\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in training walking robots to traverse uneven terrain  (165, Wensing et al., 2022). However, challenges remain in ensuring that learned control policies are robust to neglected dynamics or unexpected terrain variations.\n\nRecent advancements include teacher/student training strategies that combine proprioceptive information, privileged learning, and algorithms like TRPO (Trust Region Policy Optimization)  (167, Zhang et al., 2022). These approaches have enabled quadruped robots like ANYmal to navigate challenging terrains successfully.\n\nWhile RL and IRL methods show great potential for learning terrain traversability, they often require significant computational resources and careful design of reward functions or demonstration data. Ongoing research aims to improve the efficiency and generalizability of these approaches to handle a wider range of terrain types and robot configurations.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(11, Grizzle et al., 2022) | n_citations: 21 | Energy-Based Legged Robots Terrain Traversability Modeling via Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning ]: \nRecently, Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) for terrain traversability modeling has received increased interests, particularly for autonomous vehicles...

These methods enable robots to adapt to changing environments and improve their navigation capabilities over time.\n\nOnline and incremental learning approaches have gained significant attention in robotics for learning terrain traversability costs. These methods allow robots to update their models in real-time as they encounter new terrains, making them particularly useful for long-term autonomous operation in dynamic environments.\n\nPr\u00e1gr et al. developed a robotic system that incrementally learns to predict power consumption-based traversal costs experienced by robots over various terrains (7, Pr\u00e1gr et al., 2019). This system combines autonomous spatial exploration with simultaneous learning of the underlying traversal cost model, enabling continuous adaptation to new terrain types.\n\nBuilding on this concept, Bayer et al. proposed a system for online and incremental learning of terrain traversal costs that are immediately utilized for navigation planning  (6, Bayer et al., 2019). Their approach uses incrementally constructed Gaussian Processes with a Bayesian Committee Machine to model traversal costs based on the robot's proprioceptive experiences and terrain descriptors.\n\nIn earlier work, Muller et al. and Burgard et al. introduced systems that use sparse traversability information from stereo modules to train classifiers online  (2, Muller et al., 2007)  (3, Burgard et al., 2008). These classifiers can predict the traversability of entire scenes, leveraging temporal and spatial concurrences to achieve view-invariant predictions.\n\nProcopio et al. developed a method for long-term learning in robot navigation by selecting a subset of previously learned linear binary classifiers  (23, Procopio et al., 2007). This approach enables robots to accumulate knowledge over time and apply it to new navigation tasks.\n\nBraun introduced a technique to learn consistent cost values from scratch based on feedback from the robot during operation  (39, Braun, 2011). This method allows for more flexible and autonomous robot operation, aligning with the trend towards appearance-based terrain traversability estimation methods.\n\nThese online and incremental learning techniques represent a significant advancement in enabling robots to continuously adapt their traversability models. By learning from real-time experiences, robots can improve their navigation capabilities in diverse and changing environments, making them more robust and versatile for long-term autonomous operation.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Since this allows a more flexible and autonomous robot operation, most of the recently proposed appearance-based terrain traversability estimation methods fall into this second category.\n\n\n\nVision-Based and Proprioceptive Learning Methods\nTLDR: Vision-based and proprioceptive learning methods enable robots to estimate terrain traversability using visual data and sensor feedback. These approaches combine image processing, terrain classification, and robot experience to create adaptive traversability models.\n\nVision-based and proprioceptive learning methods have emerged as powerful tools for estimating terrain traversability in robotics. These approaches leverage visual data from cameras and proprioceptive feedback from the robot's sensors to create comprehensive traversability models.\n\nOne significant area of development is semantic segmentation of terrains using unsupervised learning techniques. These methods enable robots to reason about the possibility of traversing uneven terrains based on visual information  (5, Siva et al., 2019). This approach has been particularly useful for mobile robots navigating in unstructured environments.\n\nApprenticeship learning, also known as learning from demonstration or imitation learning, has been widely investigated to transfer human expertise in navigation control to autonomous robots  (5, Siva et al., 2019). This method allows robots to learn traversability costs directly from human demonstrations, creating a mapping from the representation space to the terrain costs encountered during traversal  (10, Konstantopoulos et al., 2022).\n\nFor multi-legged walking robots, researchers have developed methods to select suitable gaits based on terrain type. Bayer et al. implemented cost models as Gaussian Mixture regressors, providing certainty to identify unknown terrains where knowledge transfer is desirable  (13, Bayer et al., 2022). This approach allows robots to adapt their gait to different terrain conditions, enhancing their traversability capabilities.\n\nDeep learning techniques have also been applied to estimate traversability costs. Some works have adopted deep neural networks that learn local motion cost estimates from simulation, combining these estimators with variants of RRT for global path planning  (8, Yang et al., 2021). These methods enable robots to predict terrain negotiation based on images, which can then be used to plan movement and avoid high-cost terrains  (124, Nowicki et al., 2021).\n\nSelf-supervised online learning approaches have been developed to learn traversability costmaps for outdoor off-road robots using overhead imagery such as satellite images  (77, Valada et al., 2019). This method allows robots to adapt to new environments without requiring extensive pre-training.\n\nRecent research has focused on directly estimating continuous traversability costs, quantifying the difficulty of traversing particular terrains for wheeled or tracked robots  (190, Heckman et al., 2023). Some works have also proposed learning-based methods to compute foothold cost maps for legged robots, aiding in foothold selection  (155, Sartoretti et al., 2022).\n\nProprioceptive feedback has been incorporated into traversal cost learning models. By combining the robot's experienced traversal cost with terrain appearance and geometry captured by the robot's sensors, more comprehensive traversability models can be created (91, V\u00b4a\u02c7na et al., 2019).\n\nFor stereo vision-equipped robots, intelligent approaches have been developed to assess the traversability of the terrain in front of the robot  (43, Nalpantidis et al., 2012). These methods enable robots to automatically detect and avoid non-traversable areas, enhancing their autonomous navigation capabilities.\n\nSome researchers have explored using estimated terrain parameters as traversability cost functions in ground robot path planning applications  (57, Campbell et al., 2015). This approach allows for more nuanced path planning based on detailed terrain characteristics.\n\nOverall, vision-based and proprioceptive learning methods represent a significant advancement in terrain traversability estimation for robots. By combining visual data processing, terrain classification, and robot experience, these approaches enable more adaptive and robust navigation in complex environments.\n\nReferences:\n1.

These issues are compounded by the resource-intensive nature of dataset creation and the scarcity of high-quality annotated data in specialized fields.\n\nThe development of robust question answering (QA) systems for scientific domains is hindered by several significant challenges in creating suitable training datasets:\n\n1. Domain Specificity: QA models trained on general datasets often struggle when applied to scientific domains due to the specialized nature of the content. This limitation is particularly evident in biomedical QA, where the lack of large-scale, domain-specific datasets hampers performance  <Paper corpusId=\"243986045\" paperTitle=\"(76, Baksi, 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. The supervised approach to QA is heavily tied to the domain and language of the training data, restricting applications beyond the original scope  <Paper corpusId=\"237532327\" paperTitle=\"(1, Liu et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. Lack of Explanations: Many existing science question datasets lack annotated explanations for answers, which are crucial for understanding complex scientific concepts  <Paper corpusId=\"252383606\" paperTitle=\"(78, Lu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This deficiency makes it challenging to train models that can provide comprehensive and insightful responses.\n\n3. Complex Reasoning Requirements: Scientific QA often involves multi-hop reasoning, where information must be composed from multiple sources. This complexity makes both retrieval and reasoning challenging, as systems must introduce new concepts and identify valid compositions of facts  <Paper corpusId=\"204915921\" paperTitle=\"(26, Guerquin et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>. Existing datasets frequently focus on factoid-type information, failing to capture the intricate reasoning required in academic research  <Paper corpusId=\"234093776\" paperTitle=\"(48, Smith et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n4. Resource-Intensive Creation: Manually constructing large-scale QA datasets for scientific domains is extremely difficult and costly  <Paper corpusId=\"15164488\" paperTitle=\"(8, Hu et al., 2017)\" isShortName></Paper>. This challenge is particularly acute for underrepresented languages, where annotated datasets are scarce  <Paper corpusId=\"253523028\" paperTitle=\"(107, Agrawal et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n5. Diverse Question Types: Scientific QA encompasses various question types, including long-form explanations and list-based queries. Existing frameworks struggle to address the unique challenges posed by these diverse formats  <Paper corpusId=\"248157463\" paperTitle=\"(80, Stelmakh et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>  <Paper corpusId=\"256597851\" paperTitle=\"(110, Kim et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n6. Data Imbalance: Some QA datasets exhibit severe imbalances in the types of relations they cover, leading to poor generalization for questions involving long-tail relations  <Paper corpusId=\"237581581\" paperTitle=\"(68, Sun et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. This imbalance affects the ability of models to handle diverse scientific queries effectively.\n\n7. Lack of Answerability Reasoning: Many current biomedical QA datasets and methods focus solely on answerable questions, neglecting the important aspect of determining whether a question can be answered based on available information  <Paper corpusId=\"237450545\" paperTitle=\"(49, Jin et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n8. Specialized Knowledge Base Integration: In fields like biomedicine, there is a notable absence of large-scale datasets linking questions to corresponding SPARQL queries, hindering the development of end-to-end QA systems that can effectively query scientific knowledge bases <Paper corpusId=\"233423524\" paperTitle=\"(65, Robinson-Rechavi et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese challenges collectively underscore the complexity of creating comprehensive and effective training datasets for scientific QA.

These systems also struggle with bias, lack of context, and the need for human oversight.\n\n1. **Non-factual Content Generation**: One of the most serious flaws in automatic review systems is their tendency to generate non-factual statements about various aspects of paper assessment. This is particularly problematic in high-stakes settings such as academic peer review  <Paper corpusId=\"231740610\" paperTitle=\"(9, Liu et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n2. **Limited Performance**: Current automatic review generation models show considerably lower performance compared to state-of-the-art text generation models for scientific abstracts. This indicates that scientific review generation remains a challenging problem  <Paper corpusId=\"252569561\" paperTitle=\"(13, Uban et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Lack of Rejected Paper Data**: The development of automated support for peer review has been hindered by the lack of data on rejected papers and their corresponding reviews, limiting the training and evaluation of these systems  <Paper corpusId=\"196171855\" paperTitle=\"(5, Verma et al., 2019)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n4. **Synthesis and Reporting Gaps**: AI-generated literature reviews show significant gaps in retrieval, synthesis, and reporting capabilities when compared to human-authored reviews. This limitation affects the overall quality and comprehensiveness of automatically generated reviews  <Paper corpusId=\"267760070\" paperTitle=\"(30, Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n5. **Complexity of Comprehensive Reviews**: While some algorithms have shown success in generating paper summaries, they have had limited success in conducting comprehensive paper reviews. This suggests that the full complexity of the review process remains challenging for automated systems  <Paper corpusId=\"258999338\" paperTitle=\"(20, Shah et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n6. **Human Bias and Oversight**: Although automated systems aim to reduce human biases, they still require human assistance and oversight. This semi-supervised approach indicates that fully eliminating human involvement and potential biases remains a challenge  <Paper corpusId=\"10699317\" paperTitle=\"(3, Alicea, 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n7. **Contextual Understanding**: (claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620) Automatic review systems may struggle with understanding the broader context of research, including its place within the field and its potential long-term impact, which are crucial aspects of peer review.\n\n8. **Ethical Considerations**: (claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620) The use of AI in peer review raises ethical questions about transparency, accountability, and the potential for algorithmic bias, which need to be carefully addressed.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Additionally, some transformer-based summarization models have shown promising results in human evaluations, with machine-generated summaries being comparable to human-written reviews in certain cases  <Paper corpusId=\"258866124\" paperTitle=\"(26, Kasanishi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHowever, significant gaps remain between AI-generated and human-authored literature reviews, particularly in retrieval, synthesis, and reporting capabilities  <Paper corpusId=\"267760070\" paperTitle=\"(30, Zhang et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>. This highlights the ongoing need for human expertise in complex aspects of the review process. AI-assisted tools are increasingly being used to enhance the peer review process, such as suggesting relevant reviewers in different subject areas, but they are not intended to replace human reviewers entirely  <Paper corpusId=\"254591197\" paperTitle=\"(15, Kousha et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWhile automatic review systems aim to reduce human biases, they still require human assistance and oversight  <Paper corpusId=\"10699317\" paperTitle=\"(3, Alicea, 2013)\" isShortName></Paper>. This semi-supervised approach indicates that fully eliminating human involvement in the peer review process remains challenging and may not be desirable given the complex nature of scientific evaluation.\n\nIn conclusion, while automatic review generation systems show promise in assisting and potentially streamlining certain aspects of the peer review process, they are not yet capable of fully replacing human reviewers. The combination of AI-assisted tools and human expertise appears to be the most effective approach for the foreseeable future.\n\nReferences:\n1.

However, its effectiveness can vary depending on the specific strategies and models used.\n\nActive learning (AL) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). When combined with pre-trained language models (PLMs), AL has shown potential to reduce label complexity and improve model performance <Paper corpusId=\"254974513\" paperTitle=\"(1, Juki'c et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. However, the effectiveness of AL in fine-tuning LLMs is not uniform across all scenarios and depends on various factors.\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the positive impact of AL on fine-tuning LLMs. For instance, Jukic et al. found that AL is particularly effective when combined with task adaptation, while standard short fine-tuning often fails to yield significant improvements <Paper corpusId=\"254974513\" paperTitle=\"(1, Juki'c et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This finding is supported by other researchers who have observed the effectiveness of AL for fine-tuning PLMs across various domains <Paper corpusId=\"258740675\" paperTitle=\"(55, Jeleni'c et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nAL has shown benefits in specific applications and scenarios. In multilingual setups, AL in the source language has been observed to improve performance across all languages, both for named entity recognition and classification tasks  <Paper corpusId=\"247939378\" paperTitle=\"(24, Moniz et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Additionally, AL has demonstrated promise in enhancing label efficiency for novel tasks, addressing bottlenecks in label acquisition for LLMs  <Paper corpusId=\"258480084\" paperTitle=\"(54, Varadarajan et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the effectiveness of AL in fine-tuning LLMs is not without challenges. Some studies have reported limited performance gains from AL when fine-tuning large, pre-trained language models  <Paper corpusId=\"252089424\" paperTitle=\"(16, Smith et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. This observation suggests that the choice of AL strategy and its implementation are crucial factors in determining its success.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have proposed various strategies and improvements. For example, Margatina et al. introduced a simple yet effective fine-tuning method to ensure proper adaptation of LMs during AL in both low and high resource scenarios  <Paper corpusId=\"247218674\" paperTitle=\"(18, Margatina et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>. Zhang et al. developed AcTune, a framework that improves label efficiency by leveraging unlabeled data through self-training  <Paper corpusId=\"250390500\" paperTitle=\"(20, Zhang et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nRecent developments have also explored the use of AL in the context of in-context learning with LLMs. Margatina et al. demonstrated that AL algorithms can serve as effective demonstration selection methods for in-context learning across a diverse range of GPT and OPT models  <Paper corpusId=\"258841313\" paperTitle=\"(40, Margatina et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nWhile fine-tuning is often considered a solution for adapting LLMs to specific tasks, its effectiveness can vary across domains  <Paper corpusId=\"264590766\" paperTitle=\"(60, Nasir et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>. Nevertheless, studies have shown that fine-tuning can lead to improvements in performance  <Paper corpusId=\"258352368\" paperTitle=\"(56, Meltzer et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper> and enhance the near-out-of-distribution detection capability of LLMs  <Paper corpusId=\"261049411\" paperTitle=\"(61, Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nIn conclusion, while AL shows promise in improving the fine-tuning process for LLMs, its effectiveness depends on various factors, including the specific AL strategies employed, the models used, and the target tasks. Ongoing research continues to explore novel approaches to maximize the benefits of AL in the context of fine-tuning LLMs.\n\nReferences:\n1.

[(61, Liu et al., 2023) | n_citations: 1 | How Good Are LLMs at Out-of-Distribution Detection? ]: \nDespite that, we discover that fine-tuning significantly improves the near-OOD detection capability of LLMs.\n\n\n\nChallenges and Limitations of Active Learning with LLMs\nTLDR: Active learning with LLMs faces challenges such as high computational costs, the need for large amounts of representative data, and difficulties in scenarios with limited labeled data. These limitations can impact the effectiveness of active learning strategies when fine-tuning large language models.\n\nActive learning (AL) has shown promise in improving the fine-tuning process for large language models (LLMs), but it also comes with several challenges and limitations:\n\n1. **Data Requirements**: LLMs, with their vast number of parameters, typically require substantial amounts of representative data to produce good results. This requirement poses a significant challenge in the AL setting, which typically operates with a limited annotation budget  <Paper corpusId=\"237240723\" paperTitle=\"(13, Bastos et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>. The need for considerable amounts of data can make it infeasible to effectively fine-tune LLMs in many AL scenarios.\n\n2. **Computational Costs**: The computational resources required for fine-tuning LLMs are substantial. This is particularly problematic for active fine-tuning approaches that involve iteratively updating model parameters. For very large models like GPT-3.5, the computational costs associated with repeated fine-tuning can be prohibitively high  <Paper corpusId=\"264743772\" paperTitle=\"(62, Zhang et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n3. **Performance in Low-Resource Scenarios**: Fine-tuning LLMs often struggles to achieve satisfactory results in scenarios with little labeled data. This is partly due to the random initialization of the classifier parameters in the fine-tuning process, which requires sufficient labeled data for effective training  <Paper corpusId=\"245986538\" paperTitle=\"(23, Wei et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n4. **Balancing Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: While language model fine-tuning to the task corpus before active learning is critical, finding the right balance can be challenging. Too much fine-tuning can potentially be detrimental to the AL process  <Paper corpusId=\"233481800\" paperTitle=\"(9, Yang et al., 2021)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n5. **Representation Dependency**: The effectiveness of AL in combination with LLMs can vary depending on the text representations used. While transformer-based embeddings generally outperform simpler frequency-based or word embedding-based representations, choosing the optimal representation for a given task and model can be complex  <Paper corpusId=\"216562549\" paperTitle=\"(5, Lu et al., 2020)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nThese challenges highlight the need for careful consideration when applying AL strategies to LLMs. Researchers and practitioners must balance the potential benefits of AL against the computational and data requirements, especially when working with very large models or in low-resource scenarios.\n\nReferences:\n1. [(13, Bastos et al., 2021) | n_citations: 0 | ALLWAS: Active Learning on Language models in WASserstein space ]: \nActive learning is a technique for improving model performance over a fixed annotation budget...

[(23, Wei et al., 2022) | n_citations: 8 | Eliciting Knowledge from Pretrained Language Models for Prototypical Prompt Verbalizer ]: \nBy adding a classifier on the top of PLMs, fine-tuning has achieved remarkable results on supervised tasks compared with traditional methods... However, since the parameters of the classifier in fine-tuning are randomly initialized, it needs sufficient labeled data for training, thus fine-tuning is hard to obtain satisfactory results in scenarios with little labeled data\n\n4.

First, we find that language model fine-tuning to the task corpus before active learning is critical, but also that too much of it can be done.\n\n5. [(5, Lu et al., 2020) | n_citations: 17 | Investigating the Effectiveness of Representations Based on Pretrained Transformer-based Language Models in Active Learning for Labelling Text Datasets ]: \nGenerally speaking, we can observe that better performance is achieved when active learning is used in combination with a text representations based on transformerbased-embeddings rather than the simpler frequencybased representations (i.e. TF-IDF and LDA), or representations based on word embeddings (i.e. word2vec, Glove, and FastText).\n\n\n\nStrategies and Improvements for Active Learning with LLMs\nTLDR: Various strategies have been developed to enhance active learning for LLMs, including specialized fine-tuning methods, self-training approaches, and novel sampling techniques.

For instance, in contract provision classification using the LEDGAR subset of the LexGLUE benchmark, smaller models fine-tuned on legal data outperformed large general-purpose language models like ChatGPT-3.5, LLaMA-70b, and Falcon-180b by up to 19.2/26.8% in micro-F1/macro-F1 scores  <Paper corpusId=\"265213287\" paperTitle=\"(75, Farooqui et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n- **Clinical applications**: In the medical field, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have shown particular effectiveness. Specialized smaller models can operate on low-cost, in-house computing infrastructure, offering advantages in speed and reduced training costs that outweigh any performance gains from large foundation LLMs  <Paper corpusId=\"267740476\" paperTitle=\"(115, Taylor et al., 2024)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n- **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**: Domain-specific language models designed and trained specifically on HPC datasets have been hypothesized to perform better than existing large language models in this specialized field  <Paper corpusId=\"261030664\" paperTitle=\"(72, Kadosh et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n- **Highly specific queries**: Smaller models fine-tuned on specific tasks or datasets have shown improved accuracy and relevance in information retrieval for highly specific queries, leading to better outcomes for end users  <Paper corpusId=\"255340931\" paperTitle=\"(1, Awasthi et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: In domain-specific scenarios with sufficient in-domain data, fine-tuned smaller models have consistently achieved the best performance on NER tasks, especially when compared to larger models using few-shot learning  <Paper corpusId=\"259096157\" paperTitle=\"(50, Liu et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n- **Claim verification**: In tasks such as fact-checking or claim verification, fine-tuning smaller models allows for optimization of task-specific nuances, potentially enhancing classification accuracy while reducing computational costs for large-scale deployment  <Paper corpusId=\"264127942\" paperTitle=\"(64, Choi et al., 2023)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\n- **Zero-shot learning in specific domains**: Techniques like Go-tuning have successfully improved the zero-shot performance of small-size and normal-size models in specific domains, allowing them to compete with larger models  <Paper corpusId=\"254877425\" paperTitle=\"(2, Xu et al., 2022)\" isShortName></Paper>.\n\nReferences:\n1.
